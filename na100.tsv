1	Dominique Strauss-Kahn Sex-Crime Case: Accuser Lived In Apartment For HIV/AIDS Patients	The New York Post has learned that the woman accusing IMF boss Dominique Strauss-Kahn of sexual assault lived in an apartment exclusively for patients with HIV and AIDS.	"The New York Post has learned that the woman accusing IMF boss Dominique Strauss-Kahn of sexual assault lived in an apartment exclusively for patients with HIV and AIDS. From the Post: The hotel maid, a West African immigrant, has occupied the fourth-floor High Bridge pad with her 15-year-old daughter since January -- and before that, lived in another Bronx apartment set aside by Harlem Community AIDS United strictly for adults with the virus and their families. The paper was unable to confirm if the accuser has HIV or AIDS because of medical confidentiality laws, but the Post confirmed that the agency rents apartments only for adults with the disease. A Harlem United employee said at least one adult in the apartment must be HIV-positive or have AIDS to qualify to live in one of the residences. Sources told the Post that only the alleged victim and her child lived in the apartment. Strauss-Kahn is accused of forcing the woman to perform oral sex on him. She told police that after the forced act, she spit his semen onto the floor. According to the federal Centers for Disease Control : ""It is possible for either partner to become infected with HIV through performing or receiving oral sex."" Strauss-Kahn is on suicide watch at Rikers Island jail. Calls intensified for Strauss-Kahn to step down as head of the International Monetary Fund, with U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner saying Strauss-Kahn ""is obviously not in a position to run"" the agency.

2	Strauss-Kahn’s NY apartment plan falls apart	"Strauss-Kahn’s NY apartment plan falls apart AFP/New York Former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn’s release on bail was thrown into disarray yesterday when plans to put him up in a posh New York flat pending trial on sexual assault charges fell apart, a report has said.
But the New York Post tabloid, quoting unnamed sources, said Strauss-Kahn’s departure from jail may have to be put on hold after Bristol Plaza residents found out about his plans to move in and complained."	"Strauss-Kahn’s NY apartment plan falls apart AFP/New York Former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn’s release on bail was thrown into disarray yesterday when plans to put him up in a posh New York flat pending trial on sexual assault charges fell apart, a report has said. Journalists were staking out a glitzy-looking apartment building - the Bristol Plaza on East 65th Street in Manhattan - which New York television said had been rented by Strauss-Kahn’s wife, Anne Sinclair. But the New York Post tabloid, quoting unnamed sources, said Strauss-Kahn’s departure from jail may have to be put on hold after Bristol Plaza residents found out about his plans to move in and complained. One source said that “someone high-profile in the building” had objected to Strauss-Kahn staying, the Post reported. Asked if an apartment had been rented in the name of Sinclair or Strauss-Kahn, a building supervisor responded dryly, saying: “We have no guests at such name.” Strauss-Kahn, who has spent the last four nights inside Rikers Island jail after being charged with alleged sexual assault, was due to be freed wearing an electronic ankle bracelet and after posting a $1mn bail. Before he can be reunited with his wife, the man once strongly tipped to be the next president of France must also put up a $5mn bond. His lawyers will also have to satisfy judge, Michael Obus, that plans are in place for him to be placed under 24-hour surveillance, complete with video cameras, and a round-the-clock armed guard. The tough bail conditions - which will cost some $200,000 a month - were imposed after the veteran French politician was indicted on charges of sexual assault, attempted rape and unlawful imprisonment of a 32-year-old chambermaid. The Post report threw into doubt expectations that the bail package would be signed and sealed yesterday. A grand jury has indicted the 62-year-old French Socialist power baron on all seven charges arising from Saturday’s alleged sexual assault at Manhattan’s luxury Sofitel hotel. Strauss-Kahn has denied all the charges, and resigned as head of the International Monetary Fund to devote his time to fighting to clear his name. If convicted he could be forced to spend the rest of his life behind bars. Strauss-Kahn has not yet entered a formal plea. That is expected to come at his next court appearance on June 6."
3	Why is France Falling for <em>Strauss-Kahn</em> Conspiracy Talk?	"According to a worrying CSA poll, it seems that 57% of the French believe that Strauss-Kahn’s arrest results from a conspiracy.
Not long after Mitterrand’s death, the French public was surprised to discover an interview made by a Belgian TV channel in which Mitterrand dismissed a journalist for being too insistent about a recent scandal involving Mitterrand’s presidential staff illegally wiretapping various French public figures."	"According to a worrying CSA poll, it seems that 57% of the French believe that Strauss-Kahn’s arrest results from a conspiracy. The numbers have many Americans wondering: have the French lost their minds? There are though many reasons to explain the polling result. As has been written about everywhere since last Sunday, French political culture is traditionally much more tolerant about sexual matters than America’s political culture. French president Felix Faure (1841-99) famously died in a Paris brothel, and that didn’t cause much of a shock. Clemenceau quipped that the best part of love was the climb up the stairwell.  He meant: in a brothel. As far as French voters and the press are concerned, any legitimate act between consenting adults is fine and not much to worry about it. Americans are of course more religious than the French, yet that doesn’t really explain the differing views.  The French were more religious in Faure or Clemenceau’s eras than Americans today. And in any case, the lack of interest in politicians’ private lives is could itself be compatible with a generally moral attitude regarding politics, at least in theory. The problem is that it just isn’t so. In Strauss-Kahn’s case, as could be suspected, other stories are now emerging about previous incidents: one including Tristane Banon, a journalist Strauss-Kahn seems to have assaulted in 2001 or 2002 (reports differ), and a Mexican chambermaid during an official trip at a later date. Obviously, these incidents go much further than private life issues. When Strauss-Kahn was appointed to run the IMF, Jean Quatremer, a journalist from the daily Libération, blogged about possible coming troubles due to DSK’s incapacity to control his urges, but the profession ignored him while Strauss-Kahn’s communication staff asked him to remove the post (which he refused to do). What is emerging now is the realization that every political journalist in Paris was aware of the allegations surrounding Strauss-Kahn’s behavior and failed to reveal them.  No one was there to blow the whistle. Even if we put Strauss-Kahn aside, there’s a larger question: what other stories is the press holding their silence on? The French understand that there is a sense of “omerta” at work, an implicit vow of silence on the part of the media that may very well cover much more than just sexual or intimate issues. Most French papers couldn’t survive in the marketplace alone and are only still in business after having been bought out by a larger industrial group.  For their new owners, good relations with the government may be important. Other players in the French media often rely on financial aid from the state. Public TV and radio are big players too and the news agency AFP is a public company. As a profession, journalists share various corporate interests, fiscal or otherwise. The bottom line is that French journalists depend heavily on the state and are strongly unionized as well. Add to that the fact that politicians and journalists depend on each other for publicity and scoops and the general discretion about politicians’ intimate lives gets easier to understand. What remains uncertain is whether the press does a better job when it comes to reporting on corruption in general. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem to be the case. Not long after Mitterrand’s death, the French public was surprised to discover an interview made by a Belgian TV channel in which Mitterrand dismissed a journalist for being too insistent about a recent scandal involving Mitterrand’s presidential staff illegally wiretapping various French public figures. The scandal was known in France, but the interview, which showed Mitterrand in a very bad light, wasn’t released until he was out of office. The French public has been kept in an isolated news vacuum many times.  The near-complete consensus against the Iraq war in 2003 is partly explained by the almost compete absence of any dissenting points of view in the media during this period (in addition to some outright lies in reporting). The current atmosphere, with politicians feigning “shock” about Strauss-Kahn’s attack allegations and more or less insinuating that he is in trouble because he’s an affluent and influential Frenchman, are reminiscent of this period. All that makes it relatively unsurprising, but depressing, to discover that a majority of the French believe in a conspiracy against Strauss-Kahn (although there isn’t even a theory underpinning that belief). Less than a week ago, Strauss-Kahn was thought to be not exactly a perfect family man, but still a respectable person, thanks to the media’s omerta — and now he is in jail. It may take some time for the French public to make sense of it all. Hopefully though the scandal will make the public open their eyes a little more. Tweet"

Strauss-Kahn remains under house arrest since Friday night, six days after being detained on charges of sexual assault. The former IMF chief can only leave the apartment for medical reasons. Once he is taken to the apartment he will live in durong the duration of the trial, he will be able to leave for lawyer meetings, medical visits and for synagogue outings. Strauss Kahn quit as chief of the influential International Monetary Fund last week, and the organization has yet to name his successor. - (Comment) Comment - (Increase font size) (Decrease font size) Size - (Email article) email - (Print) Print - Share - - - - - - - - - Vote (Not interesting) (Little interesting) (Interesting) (Very interesting) (Indispensable) Tags: strauss kahn IMF dna sample - (Comment) - (Increase font size) (Decrease font size) - (mail) - (Print) COMMENTS > (Comment) Search...

"Sajwert houseparty, usually I try not to answer people like you as nothing penetrates a steeled bias or bigotry. But, here goes. The French doesn't always have a high opinion of Americans in general. They most often think we are unsophisticated, parochial, narrow-minded (especially about sex), and worst of all, we do NOT speak French. They give greater benefits to people in power when it comes to dishonest actions, and perp walks are absolutely never done in France. However, they have no compunction about printing the name of the victim, making sure that people know about HER, but little if anything about HIM. That said, 69% of people who believe this is a set-up are willing to cut slack for a man who has a philandering history, who has had some questionable situations with females under his power.

Did the money go to dictators or bankers and which is worse? Is there an account or some ledger we can look at? Did we get a receipt for the last 100 billion we gave them? What was Mr DSK's annual salary or was he free to grab as much as possible? Talk about a Global Socialist conspiracy of bankers, and people pull out tin-foil hats yet here we have one, so let's get some answers from him.

Instead, the head of the International Monetary Fund is accused of sexual abuse and rape and is spending the day in at 3.35 x 4 meter cell at Rikers Island jail in New York."	"IMF director general Dominique Strauss-Kahn stands before judge Melissa Jackson in Manhattan Criminal Court. As one of the most powerful men in global economics, Dominique Strauss-Kahn was supposed to give the keynote speech at the Brussels Economic Forum in Belgium on Wednesday. Instead, the head of the International Monetary Fund is accused of sexual abuse and rape and is spending the day in at 3.35 x 4 meter cell at Rikers Island jail in New York. If the name of the IMF chief's new digs rings a bell with you, chances are you've heard it on TV.  Rikers Island is best known as the home of suspects pending trial or convicts serving short sentences and as such it features regularly in New York-based police dramas such as NBC's ""Law and Order"". It evens has its own page on the show's wiki . In many ways Strauss-Kahn's arrest could be straight out of an episode of ""Law and Order: SVU"", the strand of the show that portrays detectives investigating ""sexually based offenses"". Sadly, this is real life. It was real too for rapper Lil' Wayne when he did time on Rikers Island in 2010 on a gun charge. His album ""I Am Not A Human Being"" was released while he was in solitary confinement, and he even recorded a verse over the phone for the Drake/Jay-Z single ""Light Up"". The ""Rikers Remix"" did the rounds online. Rikers Island, where IMF head Dominique Strauss-Kahn is being held. Lil' Wayne is just one of many artists to have referenced Rikers Island in their lyrics. Recent Eminem/D12 collaboration ""Going Crazy"" describes a ""tour bus look like Rikers Island"". Meanwhile, if Kool G. Rap's lyrics are anything to go by, Dominique Strauss-Kahn may have a rough time in store at the jail: ""...you might have been robbin', you might have been whylin'/ But you won't be smilin' on Rikers island. / Just to hear the name it makes your spine tingle/ This is a jungle where the murderers mingle/ This ain't a place that's crowded but there's room for you/ Whether you're white or you're black, you'll be black and blue..."" This Wednesday we heard that the man whom many refer to as DSK was placed on suicide watch at Rikers Island, but that is a common procedure in high-profile cases. Strauss-Kahn is expected to be left largely alone between now and his next appearance in court on Friday. CNN Legal Analyst Sunny Hostin says a second application for bail will be the top priority. ""There is no question that this Friday the defense will reapply for bail"", he told CNN's Anderson Cooper 360 . ""They're going to try to come up with a situation that is palatable for the prosecution and the court so that he is no longer being held at Rikers Island. That may include $1 million to $2 million bail, or an ankle monitoring bracelet"". As the Grand Jury convenes, the world will be watching. Posted by: Ally Barnard , CNN Producer Filed under: General"

The onetime French presidential contender has been living in the lower Manhattan skyscraper since his release Friday from Rikers Island on $1 million bail."	"NEW YORK -- With armed guards and cameras watching his every move, former IMF leader Dominique Strauss-Kahn remained holed up Sunday in a pricey high-rise while he awaits a more permanent location for house arrest in his sexual assault case. The onetime French presidential contender has been living in the lower Manhattan skyscraper since his release Friday from Rikers Island on $1 million bail. He's been accused of trying to rape a housekeeper in his $3,000-a-night hotel suite last weekend but has denied the allegations. He's scheduled for arraignment on June 6. The 62-year-old Strauss-Kahn was initially set for a tony apartment complex on the Upper East Side, but tenants in the building complained about the throng of police and media gathered outside. So instead, Strauss-Kahn was ensconced in the 21-story Empire Building within the New York Police Department's ring of steel, a network of private and police cameras. It's not clear when and where he'd be moved to a more permanent house arrest; calls to his attorney and to the security firm weren't returned. Even with the severe restrictions, Strauss-Kahn's family wealth has afforded him one of the cushiest bail agreements possible. But it won't come cheap. The cost to secure the former International Monetary Fund chief was estimated at $200,000 a month – and he must foot the bill. In comparison, it costs the city about $6,500 a month to house an inmate at a facility like Rikers Island, where he had been held nearly a week. The funds will go toward armed surveillance, the installation of cameras and a special bracelet shackled to his ankle that will set off an alarm if he travels too far. Right now, he's not allowed out at all, but after he's moved to a more permanent location he can leave for court, doctor visits and weekly religious services. Prosecutors must be notified at least six hours before he goes anywhere. He can't be out between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. But he won't be lonely: Strauss-Kahn can have visitors – up to four at a time in addition to family. Meanwhile, the IMF has been working to find a successor to lead an organization that provides billions in loans to stabilize the world economy. France's finance minister, Christine Lagarde, has emerged as a front-runner to replace Strauss-Kahn. The executive board said it plans to make its selection by the end of June."

"(Breaking news graphic) (Antler) DNA test results showed a match between traces of semen on a Sofitel hotel maid's shirt and a sample submitted by Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former director of the IMF who is accused of sexually assaulting her. Law enforcement officials confirmed the DNA match, the Wall Street Journal reported. Strauss-Kahn , who was accused of sexually assaulting the Sofitel employee and was removed from an Air France flight at JFK Airport in New York on May 14, submitted to the DNA test after his arrest. The DNA was found on a shirt worn by the 32-year-old maid. Pieces of carpet were also taken for testing from the New York hotel's penthouse suite where Strauss-Kahn was staying when the alleged assault occurred. DNA results are expected to play a significant role in his trial. Witnesses at the hotel told an official that the maid appeared upset when Strauss-Kahn passed her in the hall when he was leaving, minutes after the alleged attack occurred, the Journal also reported: She was shaken up, the official said, ""quite upset"" and ""had to be consoled."" At some point while the maid was being consoled by the other hotel workers, Mr. Strauss-Kahn walked out of his hotel room, down the hallway and onto the elevator. The DNA match was reported first by a French web site, Atlantico.fr, which cited no source. When Strauss-Kahn was arrested in New York on May 14, one of the first people to spread the news was a shareholder in Atlantico.fr, Arnaud Dassier. Dassier has a history with Nicolas Sarkozy, the center-right president of France; he ran his online election campaign in 2007, according to the New York Times. Strauss-Kahn, a Socialist, was expected to declare his candidacy to run against an increasingly unpopular Sarkozy in the French presidential elections next year, and many media outlets in France have raised questions about the Strauss-Kahn arrest, pointing out that Sarkozy had much to gain if Strauss-Kahn were out of the running. Strauss-Kahn has resigned his position at the IMF, but maintains his innocence of the charges."

Ireland's Europe Minister Lucinda Creighton said it was quite likely Ireland would back a Lagarde candidacy.
""Already you have the backing of New Zealand and a number of European member states for Christine Lagarde."	"China would support Finance Minister Christine Lagarde as the next IMF chief, the French government said on Tuesday, backing which would put her firmly in pole position to succeed Dominique Strauss-Kahn. Lagarde has emerged as the leading candidate to replace Strauss-Kahn, who quit last week to fight sexual assault charges in New York, although Mexico is pushing the claims of its central bank chief and many emerging nations have said it is time for Europe's 60-year grip on the job to be loosened. European governments want to retain their traditional control over the leadership of the multilateral lender while it is involved in major bailouts of Greece, Ireland and Portugal. A number, including Britain and Italy, have already said they would back Lagarde and Ireland added its support on Tuesday. ""It's a European consensus,"" France's budget minister and government spokesman Francois Baroin told Europe 1 radio, asked about Lagarde as a possible contender for the job. ""The euro needs our attention, we need to have the Europeans (on board), the Chinese support the candidacy of Christine Lagarde,"" he said. China's foreign ministry said it had no comment on whether Beijing would back Lagarde, a 55-year-old former lawyer, to lead the International Monetary Fund. Last week, the head of China's central bank, Zhou Xiaochuan, said the IMF's future leadership should reflect the growing stature of emerging economies, but he stopped short of saying its new boss should be from an emerging economy. Ireland's Europe Minister Lucinda Creighton said it was quite likely Ireland would back a Lagarde candidacy. ""Already you have the backing of New Zealand and a number of European member states for Christine Lagarde. I think it's quite possible that the U.S. will row in behind her as well,"" Irish Europe Minister Lucinda Creighton told state broadcaster RTE. The leadership race was triggered by Strauss-Kahn's resignation last week, after a New York hotel maid accused him of attempted rape. NO ONE EMERGING CANDIDATE A ""gentleman's agreement"" has always had a European lead the IMF and an American the World Bank, but fast-growing emerging nations are seeking a larger role in global organisations. Sources in Washington have said it would back a European for the post. The United States and European nations jointly hold more than half of the IMF's votes, giving them enough power to decide who leads it. The fund is currently being run by its No. 2 official, John Lipksy, who has said he wants to step down in August, and it has set a June 30 deadline to pick a permanent head. On Monday, Mexico sought support for its central bank governor, Agustin Carstens, but Brazil appeared reluctant to back him, saying more time was needed to make a choice. Brazilian government sources said some officials feel Carstens is a long-shot for the job. Russia has said it would back Kazakhstan's central bank chief, Grigory Marchenko, and sources have said South African politician Trevor Manuel could also emerge as a candidate. Lagarde, a skilled negotiator and fluent English-speaker who was named the euro zone's best finance minister last year by the Financial Times, has not commented on her possible nomination but few doubt she would want the job. Ringing the opening bell at the NYSE Euronext exchange in Paris on Tuesday, Lagarde grinned at reporters asking about her possible nomination, but dodged answering their questions.

13	"Out on bail, ex-IMF chief arrives on Broadway"	"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn was settling into a new, temporary abode on Friday on New York's Broadway but he was a long way from the neon lights and theaters that make the street famous.
It is close to Wall Street and the Ground Zero site of the of September 11, 2001 al Qaeda attacks on the World Trade Center, within the city's security ""ring of steel,"" which includes surveillance cameras and an increased police presence.
Some New Yorkers in the area weren't happy about having such a controversial new neighbor."	"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn was settling into a new, temporary abode on Friday on New York's Broadway but he was a long way from the neon lights and theaters that make the street famous. Under armed guard and with a security bracelet strapped to his ankle, Strauss-Kahn is stuck at the less glamorous end of the thoroughfare that slices across Manhattan. It is close to Wall Street and the Ground Zero site of the of September 11, 2001 al Qaeda attacks on the World Trade Center, within the city's security ""ring of steel,"" which includes surveillance cameras and an increased police presence. Charged with trying to rape a hotel housekeeper, Strauss-Kahn was released on bail on Friday after spending four nights under suicide watch in an 11-by-13-foot (3-by-4 meter) cell at New York's harsh, loud and dangerous Rikers Island jail. Strauss-Kahn has denied the charges and said he will fight to clear his name. His new home was arranged by a private security company which Strauss-Kahn is paying to keep him under 24-hour armed guard and electronically monitor him as part of his bail conditions. Prosecutors have estimated the cost of his security would be $200,000 a month. The building on the corner of Broadway and Rector Street is next door to Trinity Episcopal church. Some New Yorkers in the area weren't happy about having such a controversial new neighbor. One man held up a pink cardboard sign that read: ""D.S.K. Not In my Backyard."" ""With all the press and publicity it's going to be hard to come and go in the building,"" Debbie Tawil, a resident of the building, told reporters. Strauss-Kahn, who oversaw the world economy while at the International Monetary Fund, is only allowed to leave his apartment for travel within Manhattan for court appearances, meetings with his lawyers, medical appointments and a weekly religious observance. His time there will likely be temporary as Strauss-Kahn's wife and defense lawyers are still trying to find another apartment to rent. Strauss-Kahn's arraignment hearing is set for June 6, when he will formally answer the charges. A trial may be six months or more away. If convicted, he could face 25 years in prison. His wife, French television journalist Anne Sinclair, had reportedly rented a luxury apartment on Manhattan's Upper East Side in the Bristol Plaza, where a two-bedroom suite costs up to $14,200 a month. ""The reason that we had to move is because members of the press attempted to invade his private residence,"" Strauss-Kahn's lawyer William Taylor told reporters. At the Bristol Plaza, Strauss-Kahn would have had goose down pillows, daily maid service and a soaking tub in an Italian marble bathroom. Building manager, Milstein Properties, declined to comment on media reports that it refused to rent to Sinclair after it became aware of the high-profile tenant. Strauss-Kahn would also not have been the first personality to be confined to an apartment in the swank neighborhood, where just a few blocks away disgraced financier Bernard Madoff was detained in his penthouse. Madoff is now in prison, serving a 150-year sentence for Wall Street's biggest investment fraud. (Writing by Michelle Nichols; Editing by Eric Walsh )"
14	Jailed IMF chief under pressure to quit	"Dominique Strauss-Kahn faced growing pressure to quit as head of the IMF after his arrest on attempted rape charges, and Europe sought to fend off a challenge from developing countries to fill a post it has traditionally held.
But Brazilian Finance Minister Guido Mantega said the Strauss-Kahn affair should not be used as a way to press for changes in the way the IMF head is picked, telling GloboNews TV the discussion ""is too premature at this point""."	"Dominique Strauss-Kahn faced growing pressure to quit as head of the IMF after his arrest on attempted rape charges, and Europe sought to fend off a challenge from developing countries to fill a post it has traditionally held. China, Brazil and South Africa questioned Europe's right to the job but Europeans said it made sense for them to retain the post while the International Monetary Fund plays such a crucial role in helping to ease the euro zone debt crisis. Strauss-Kahn is expected to remain in New York's Rikers Island jail, known for its gang violence, at least until his next appearance in court on Friday, when his lawyers may again request bail. He was denied bail on Monday. It could be six months before a trial begins, legal experts said, which could severely impair his ability to run the Fund. The IMF said it had not been in touch with Strauss-Kahn since his arrest but it would be important to do so ""in due course"". Two IMF board sources told Reuters the board would ask Strauss-Kahn whether he planned to continue in his post. One source said it would be ideal if Strauss-Kahn resigned, but the second said that sentiment was not shared across the 24-member board, which has the authority to remove him. Strauss-Kahn is accused of trying to rape a maid who came to clean his luxury suite at the Sofitel hotel in Manhattan on Saturday. His lawyer has said he will plead not guilty. If convicted, he could face 25 years in prison. In the United States, the IMF's biggest shareholder, politicians began questioning the viability of his tenure as head of the institution charged with managing the world economy and central to negotiating debt crisis deals. ""I can't comment on the case, but he is obviously not in a position to run the IMF,"" U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said. John Lipsky, the second-in-command, is in charge during Strauss-Kahn's absence, but no formal interim chief has been named. IMF sources told Reuters that David Lipton, White House international economic adviser and former deputy treasury secretary, would take Lipsky's deputy position. Strauss-Kahn's arrest has thrown the IMF into turmoil just as it is helping euro zone states like Greece and Portugal tackle debt woes. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry stopped short of calling for Strauss-Kahn's resignation, but he called the circumstances of the case ""troubling if not damning"". ""If the evidence is what it appears to be, I think it would be very difficult for him to manage,"" Kerry said. In Europe, Strauss-Kahn was also losing support. ""Given the situation, that bail has been denied, he has to consider that he would otherwise do damage to the institution,"" said Austrian Finance Minister Maria Fekter. Spanish Economy Minister Elena Salgado cast doubt on Strauss-Kahn's judgment but said it was his decision whether to resign. ""That is a decision which is up to Mr Strauss-Kahn to take, but the crimes he is accused of are very serious ... My solidarity first and foremost is with the woman who suffered the attack, if that was what happened,"" she told reporters. EUROPEAN JOB A European has held the post of managing director since the IMF was created in 1945, and four of them have been Frenchmen. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso told Dutch television on Monday he did not want to speculate about replacing Strauss-Kahn, but added: ""If a succession is necessary, European countries should present a candidate."" But emerging countries are starting to flex their muscle over who should succeed him. He had been expected to leave soon anyway to run for French president. China said on Tuesday the selection of the next IMF boss should be based on ""fairness, transparency and merit"". It marked the first time that China, the fund's third largest member, weighed in early and so publicly on an IMF selection debate. South African Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and a senior Brazilian government official, who asked not to be named, said the next chief should be from a developing country, pressing a case to give emerging economies a greater say in world affairs. But Brazilian Finance Minister Guido Mantega said the Strauss-Kahn affair should not be used as a way to press for changes in the way the IMF head is picked, telling GloboNews TV the discussion ""is too premature at this point"". ""I am all appalled by this situation and I really hope that the situation gets resolved so Dominique can return -- he is probably one of the best IMF chiefs that we had in the past years,"" Mantega said. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Monday the Fund's role in tackling the euro zone crisis meant it made sense for Europe to keep the job, although the post could go to the developing world in the future. French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde is thought to be interested in the post but her prospects have been clouded by a decision this month by a public prosecutor to recommend a full-scale inquiry into her role in awarding financial compensation to a prominent businessman in 2008. SOCIALIST SOLIDARITY IN FRANCE French President Nicolas Sarkozy urged members of his centre-right party to show ""restraint and dignity"" and refrain from comment on the case, participants at a breakfast meeting said. Socialists, stunned by the arrest of their leading candidate to challenge Sarkozy for the presidency next year, vowed to stick to their timetable to select a candidate by October. Many have been outraged by the way New York police paraded Strauss-Kahn -- handcuffed and unshaven -- before the world's media before he had been able to defend himself in court. Former Culture Minister Jack Lang called the treatment a ""lynching"" that had ""provoked horror and aroused disgust"". Other senior Socialists said it violated his right to be presumed innocent until found guilty by a court. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg agreed such a display was humiliating and would be unfair if a defendant were to be found innocent. ""But if you don't want to do the perp walk, don't do the crime,"" he told reporters. ""I don't have a lot of sympathy for that. Our judicial system works where the public can see the alleged perpetrators."" The lawyer for the alleged victim, 32, said she was traumatised and in hiding. He said she was a widow with a 15-year-old daughter, who moved to New York from the West African nation of Guinea about seven years ago, he said. ""She didn't have any idea who he was or have any prior dealings with this guy (Strauss-Kahn),"" Jeffrey Shapiro, a New York personal injury lawyer, told Reuters."

"(IMFDSK) REUTERS Former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn (C) sits inside of a New York State Supreme Courthouse following a recess during his bail hearing in New York May 19, 2011. Strauss-Kahn was granted bail by a New York judge on Thursday, and the former IMF chief has vowed to fight charges that he tried to rape a hotel maid in Manhattan. Lawyers for Dominique Strauss-Kahn are searching for a new apartment for the former IMF leader, who spent the weekend under house arrest in New York amid charges that he attacked a hotel maid. Strauss-Kahn is temporarily staying with his wife at a luxury high-rise in lower Manhattan. Attorney Benjamin Brafman said Friday that the couple would need to find permanent housing. He declined to comment Monday. French and U.S. media have been staking out the building where Strauss-Kahn was moved Friday from his Rikers Island jail cell. The 62-year-old is accused of attacking a 32-year-old housekeeper on May 14 in his $3,000-a-night hotel suite. He has denied the allegations.

16	"Posh, pricey NYC house arrest for ex-IMF leader"	"This is Dominique Strauss-Kahn 's new jail away from jail, after the former IMF leader charged with sexually assaulting a maid left a New York City jail for a posh and pricey house arrest.
Even with the severe restrictions, Strauss-Kahn's family wealth has afforded him one of the cushiest bail agreements possible.
"" But the freedom from jail meant dealing with the press -- and lawyers in Strauss-Kahn's case said the international media frenzy over his case changed the house arrest plans."	"NEW YORK—Armed guards stand watch 24 hours a day. Cameras record every move, and monitors alert authorities should the prisoner try to escape. This is Dominique Strauss-Kahn's new jail away from jail, after the former IMF leader charged with sexually assaulting a maid left a New York City jail for a posh and pricey house arrest. The plans hit a snag Friday when a tony Upper East Side apartment complex refused to accept the one-time French presidential candidate because of unwanted media attention. Instead, Strauss-Kahn was ensconced Saturday in a lower Manhattan high-rise within the New York Police Department's ring of steel, a network of private and police cameras. He's guarded by Stroz Friedberg, the same security firm that kept disgraced financier Bernard Madoff under surveillance in his own penthouse. It's not clear when and where he'd be moved to a more permanent house arrest; calls to his attorney and to the security firm weren't returned Saturday. Even with the severe restrictions, Strauss-Kahn's family wealth has afforded him one of the cushiest bail agreements possible. But it won't come cheap. The cost to secure the former International Monetary Fund chief was estimated at about $200,000 a month -- and he must foot the bill. In comparison, it costs the city about $6,500 a month to house an inmate at a facility like Rikers Island, where he has been held nearly a week. The funds will go toward armed surveillance, the installation of cameras and a special bracelet shackled to his ankle that will set off an alarm if he travels too far. Right now, he's not allowed out at all, but after he's moved to a more permanent location he can leave for court, doctor visits and weekly religious services. Prosecutors must be notified at least six hours before he goes anywhere. He can't be out between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. And he won't be lonely: Strauss-Kahn can take visitors -- up to four at a time in addition to family. The 62-year-old was indicted by a grand jury this week on charges including criminal sexual abuse and attempted rape in the alleged attack last weekend at the Sofitel near Manhattan's Times Square. He was held at the jail initially because a judge sided with prosecutors who believed he was a substantial flight risk, given his wealth and international status, and worried if he was simply released he'd flee to France, which has extradition laws that favor its residents. His lawyers initially requested his release on $1 million bail, but revised the plan later in the week to add stricter house arrest restrictions. State Supreme Justice Michael J. Obus signed off on the plan and ordered Strauss-Kahn's release from Rikers Island on Friday. A spokeswoman for Stroz Friedberg had no comment on their latest client. The company has a history of high-stakes, high-wealth clients: It secured Mahender and Varsha Sabhnani, a rich Long Island couple convicted of enslaving two domestic servants they brought from Indonesia by keeping their travel documents while having them perform forced labor. Over the course of the couple's home detention, the firm was chastised by a judge for allowing Mahender Sabhnani to stay out at business meetings in Manhattan until 1 a.m. And then there's Madoff, who was under house arrest for over a year before he began serving a 150-year prison term in 2009 for swindling investors of billions. In a case study posted on its website on its involvement with Madoff, the company said round-the-clock monitoring was done by retired federal and high-ranking New York City officers who kept tabs on everything, from deliveries in and out of the building to recording his every move. Security experts say it would take at least three experienced guards to do the job well in Strauss-Kahn's case -- two working at all times and one on reserve. ""You can't to go sleep. You need fresh guys all the time,"" said Beau Dietl, a longtime former NYPD detective who now does security and is a private eye. ""You can't let the guy out of your sight."" Nick Casale, who guarded Madoff initially, said the prisoner's wealth must be taken into account. ""For the average person, $1 million cash bail is astronomical. But you have to look at how this would impact his wealth, is it substantial, or is it trivial?"" Lawyers said in court Strauss-Kahn was worth about $2 million, but his wife, journalist Anne Sinclair, is substantially wealthy, and helped secure the $5 million bond the judge added to the bail agreement. Experts say such agreements are becoming increasingly common for well-heeled defendants -- the most high-profile being Madoff, who was under private guard and had cameras trained on him 24 hours a day. Strauss-Kahn's lawyers cited the case -- in which Madoff posted $10 million bail -- as a reason to release the economist. Some other white-collar bail agreements make Madoff's look puny. In 2008, David Brooks, formerly the top supplier of body armor to the U.S. military, was released on $400 million bond under a house arrest term that called for electronic monitoring and an armed guard in his apartment. His bail was revoked in 2010 when a federal judge ruled that he had schemed to hide assets from the court. Raj Rajaratnam, a one-time billionaire hedge fund founder convicted of insider trading, is currently free on $100 million bail, but under house arrest at his Manhattan home while he awaits sentencing July 29. It's just a fact, experts say, that money can buy you a sweeter deal while you wait for your criminal case to go to trial. ""So now what we're saying is that people of status and class and power can perpetrate these type of crimes, hire an expensive legal team, and meet the conditions of bail to satisfy the court to secure their freedom,"" said Nick Casale, a security expert who guarded Madoff. ""Are we going to this caste system of defendants?"" But the freedom from jail meant dealing with the press -- and lawyers in Strauss-Kahn's case said the international media frenzy over his case changed the house arrest plans. Strauss-Kahn decided not to move to the Upper East Side luxury building ""out of respect for the residents"" who objected to the international media converging on the complex, Strauss-Kahn attorney William Taylor said. On Friday, Donna Mancino said she couldn't get a working elevator to her apartment while Strauss-Kahn was being moved in. But she and other residents said the only disruptive aspect of his presence was the press staking him out. ""He has to stay somewhere -- and there are a lot of criminals on Wall Street,"" she said. Strauss-Kahn is accused of attacking a 32-year-old housekeeper Saturday in his $3,000-a-night hotel suite. The West African immigrant told police he chased her down a hallway in the suite, forced her to perform oral sex and tried to remove her stockings. He is scheduled for arraignment on June 6. ------(equals) Associated Press Writer David B. Caruso contributed to this report. © Copyright 2011 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The apartment building on Broadway in Manhattan's Financial District, several blocks from the World Trade Center site, rents two-bedroom apartments starting at $4,250 a month, with 9-foot ceilings, bay windows and walk-in closets."	"IMF chief released from jail under house arrest By JENNIFER PELTZ and COLLEEN LONG Associated Press Published: Saturday, May 21, 2011 at 4:30 a.m. Last Modified: Saturday, May 21, 2011 at 12:08 a.m. Former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn was released from jail Friday to house arrest in a landmark apartment building near ground zero after the luxury apartment where he had arranged to stay fell through because the neighbors objected to the media frenzy. Prosecutors said he would stay temporarily in lower Manhattan while his family and lawyers look for more permanent housing for him to await trial on charges he tried to rape a hotel maid. Strauss-Kahn was moved from a Rikers Island cell into a 21-story granite skyscraper called the Empire Building, a person familiar with his housing arrangements told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity because the person wasn't authorized to speak publicly. The original plan was for Strauss-Kahn to move into a luxury residential hotel under armed guard on Manhattan's well-to-do Upper East Side. Even though the address was never officially released, police and media converged on the building, the Bristol Plaza. ""Last night there was an effort by the media to invade the building,"" Strauss-Kahn attorney William Taylor said. ""That is why the tenants in the building will not accept his living there."" While Strauss-Kahn's family had a lease and could have stayed, he decided to leave ""out of respect for the residents."" Late in the day, after the snag over where the banker would serve his house arrest had been resolved, Strauss-Kahn was released from the city's Rikers Island jail on $1 million cash bail. The 62-year-old former managing director of the powerful International Monetary Fund had been behind bars since last Saturday. During his time at the Empire Building, at least one armed guard will be watching him at all times, and he will have to wear an ankle bracelet. His apartment's exterior doors will be outfitted with alarms and video cameras, on orders from the judge who granted bail. ""This is intended to be temporary, meaning a few days, and in the meantime, efforts would be made to arrange for another suitable residence,"" state Supreme Court Justice Michael Obus said. The apartment building on Broadway in Manhattan's Financial District, several blocks from the World Trade Center site, rents two-bedroom apartments starting at $4,250 a month, with 9-foot ceilings, bay windows and walk-in closets. Prosecutors had argued against Strauss-Kahn's release, warning he might use his wealth and international connections to flee to France and thwart efforts to extradite him, like the filmmaker Roman Polanski. Strauss-Kahn cannot leave his temporary housing at all. Once he is settled somewhere permanent, he will be allowed to leave only for court dates, meetings with his lawyers, doctor's appointments and weekly religious services, and he will have to give prosecutors at last six hours' notice. No trial date has been set. He is accused of attacking a 32-year-old housekeeper in his $3,000-a-night hotel suite. The West African immigrant told police he emerged naked from the bathroom, chased her down and forced her to perform oral sex. He has denied the allegations. On the Upper East Side, tenants of Bristol Plaza - featuring furnished apartments with Italian marble bathrooms, flat-screen televisions, king-size beds with goose down pillows - were upset at the prospect of a media feeding frenzy outside their door. The wealthy neighborhood attracts a crush of dignitaries from the United Nations, and Bernard Madoff lived close by. ""I didn't want him here,"" said Dolores Gonzalez, who was afraid the spectacle would tarnish the building's dignified reputation. Her neighbor Charles Katz agreed: ""It's going to be very crowded, noisy, attracting the press and other people."" --- Associated Press writers Tom Hays and Karen Zraick contributed to this report."

"Distraught family of DSK accuser look to God 24 May 2011 13:28 Source: reuters // Reuters * Strauss-Kahn's accuser hails from remote African village * Brother speaks of devout Muslim childhood amid poverty By Saliou Samb LABE REGION, Guinea, May 24 (Reuters) - In a living room bare but for a few family photos and Islamic texts, the African man who says he is the brother of Dominique Strauss-Kahn's accuser says he has not slept or eaten properly for days. ""I heard the news on the radio and honestly I do not know what happened. I want to speak to my sister,"" the man, called Mamoudou, told Reuters at a village in the Labe region of Guinea, a hard day's drive north of the capital Conakry. Mamoudou, whose family name and home village are withheld to protect the identity of the alleged assault victim, said he had not heard from his younger sister for several years. But he had no doubt that she was the 32-year-old Guinean widow who filed the complaint in New York. Her name has appeared in local media. In the community of devout Muslims, religion provides solace for those with troubles far away, and for poverty at home. A hamlet of 20 dwellings lost in the rural depths of this impoverished West African country, Mamoudou's village is a world away from the luxury suite of the Times Square Sofitel where the now former chief of the International Monetary Fund and French presidential contender is accused of trying to rape the maid. There is no electricity or mains water and the village is accessible only on foot through dense forest. A few scattered agricultural tools and cows point to the subsistence farming that allows the residents of the hamlet to eke out a living. ""In our family, we are above material things,"" said Mamoudou, who is aged about 50. ""Even if you are a billionaire, we don't care. The most important thing for us is how you follow God's path."" Following up on details of his client given by U.S. lawyer Jeffrey Shapiro, Reuters spoke to people in the Guinean expatriate community in New York and, to people in Conakry with roots in the Labe region to trace Mamoudou and his family. WIDOW'S JOURNEY Sitting with his half-brother Aboubacar, he points to a slightly out-of-focus photograph on the living room wall of a young woman in traditional West African dress looking at the camera, with little expression. ""After the death of her husband ... she left the village because none of his brothers was old enough to marry her,"" Mamoudou said of his sister, referring to common local practice for widows to marry a brother of their late husband. As the eldest of their parents' six children, it fell to Mamoudou to ensure his younger sister was cared for: ""That's when I took her to Bambeto to learn to sew,"" he said. Bambeto is a suburb of the capital and offered the young widow the chance to learn a trade that could feed her and her child. ""(She) never created any problems for this family,"" Mamoudou said. ""She was the quiet one. That's how she was brought up."" From Conakry, his sister made her way to the United States some years ago. Her lawyer has said her daughter is now aged 15. Few Guineans have seen much benefit from the country's role as the world's top exporter of the aluminium ore bauxite. Per capita average annual income is $407, or just over a dollar day. It was last year before Guinea held its first democratic election after a half a century of independence from France that has been marred by coups, corruption and oppressive misrule. Religion loomed large in the family under his father known locally as an Islamic scholar, Mamoudou said. That background, he said, made it hard for them to relate to the world of global finance, luxury hotels and allegations of sexual misconduct in which his sister has found herself embroiled: ""We have trouble understanding all this because it is not something we are used to,"" he said. ""If my sister is saying what she is saying, given how she was brought up, I believe her."" (Writing by Mark John; Editing by Alastair Macdonald)"

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Before she started working at the Sofitel hotel in New York's bustling Times Square area, the maid who accused IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn of trying to rape her spent her daily life within the same few city blocks. The neighbourhood where she lived and worked, a section of the Bronx lined with tiny grocers, hair salons and dollar stores, once infamously violent, is a hilly place called Concourse just north of Yankee Stadium. There, the single mother and widow from Guinea used to work an evening shift in a tiny takeout joint, African American Restaurant, located on the corner of a busy intersection. She lived with her daughter; most recently in an apartment building just 12 blocks away. ""She helped my wife,"" said the restaurant's owner, Bahoreh Jabbie, 60, who said he hired her after she came into the restaurant and asked his wife, Fatima, for help finding a job. ""She walked by herself when she came and she walked by herself when she left,"" he said, ""I never saw her taking a free ride from nobody."" Jabbie, who immigrated to New York from Gambia and has run the restaurant since 2002, said he knew little of the woman's life outside the restaurant, but that her daughter would come in occasionally to buy something. LOW-KEY EXISTENCE Other details of the woman's existence remain mysterious. Leaders of an organization that supports immigrants from a specific region in the woman's native Guinea in West Africa are trying to contact her to offer their help. ""She came to our attention on the news,"" said Mamadousidy Barry, 38, a spokesman for the organization called Pottalfiibhantal. Barry believes the woman is from the region Pottalfiibhantal focuses on: Fouta Djallon, in central Guinea. But the leader of the mosque where Pottalfiibhantal operates has said he does not know her. She was not actively involved in the Muslim community which people in the neighbourhood say should have been hers, based on her native region. ""There are some people, they just like to be alone and take care of their own business,"" Barry said. Prosecutors have accused Strauss-Kahn, 62, of attacking the woman when she entered his suite, apparently unaware it was occupied. During Strauss-Kahn's first appearance at Manhattan Criminal Court on Monday, prosecutors said he had sexually assaulted the maid, attempted to rape her and then forced her to perform oral sex on him. Strauss-Kahn's lawyers denied the charges of a criminal sexual act, attempted rape, sexual abuse, unlawful imprisonment and forcible touching. He was denied bail on Monday and a bail hearing is due to be held on Thursday.

20	French politician on suicide watch in New York	"Calls intensified for the 62-year-old Strauss-Kahn to step down as head of the powerful International Monetary Fund, with U.S.
On Tuesday her lawyer, Jeffrey Shapiro, said he had no doubts his client was telling the truth about her encounter with Strauss-Kahn on Saturday.
But this humble immigrant life was shattered, police say, on Saturday afternoon, when the woman entered Strauss-Kahn's suite at the Sofitel to clean the room."	"Calls intensified for the 62-year-old Strauss-Kahn to step down as head of the powerful International Monetary Fund, with U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner saying Strauss-Kahn ""is obviously not in a position to run"" the agency. Strauss-Kahn was one of France's most high-profile politicians and a potential candidate for president in next year's elections. His arrest on charges including attempted rape shocked France and cast intense attention on his accuser, a 32-year-old chambermaid from the West African nation of Guinea. On Tuesday her lawyer, Jeffrey Shapiro, said he had no doubts his client was telling the truth about her encounter with Strauss-Kahn on Saturday. ""She came from a country in which poor people had little or no justice, and she's now in a country where the poor have the same rights as do the rich and the powerful,"" Shapiro said. ""What (Strauss-Kahn) might be able to get away with in some countries, he can't here in this country."" Strauss-Kahn's lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said defense lawyers believe the forensic evidence ""will not be consistent with a forcible encounter."" But Shapiro dismissed suggestions that the woman had made up the charges or tried to cover up a consensual encounter. ""There is no way in which there is any aspect of this event which could be construed consensual in any manner,"" Shapiro said in an interview in his Manhattan office. ""This is nothing other than a physical, sexual assault by this man on this young woman."" Strauss-Kahn is also charged with sex abuse, a criminal sex act, unlawful imprisonment and forcible touching. The most serious charge carries five to 25 years in prison. Because of his high profile, he was being held Tuesday at Rikers Island in a section of the jail that normally houses prisoners with highly contagious diseases like measles or tuberculosis. Corrections spokesman Stephen Morello said Strauss-Kahn has been placed in a wing with about 14 cells, all of them empty except for his. Norman Seabrook, president of the correction officers union, said Strauss-Kahn did or said something during a mental health evaluation that concerned doctors, and he is being monitored day and night. A law enforcement official, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of prisoner medical information, said Strauss-Kahn had not tried to harm himself. Strauss-Kahn's cell has a toilet and a sink. He takes his meals there, with breakfast at 5 a.m., lunch at 11 a.m. and dinner at 4 or 5 p.m. Morello said Strauss-Kahn can occasionally leave his cell and wander the wing, and can go outside for an hour each day. Because he is awaiting trial, Strauss-Kahn isn't required to wear a prison uniform. He may bring his own clothing and wear what he chooses, except for his shoes. All prisoners are required to wear prison-issue slip-on sneakers. Also, he must change out of his street clothes and put on a gray jumpsuit when he wishes to see visitors. The suits are designed without pockets or other hiding places where a person could stash contraband. Meanwhile in Europe, Strauss-Kahn's past conduct with other women was getting new scrutiny. The IMF investigated him following a 2008 affair with an employee, the Hungarian-born economist Piroska Nagy. The institution eventually cleared him of wrongdoing, but a person close to Nagy said Tuesday that she had sent the organization a letter at the time warning about his behavior toward women. The letter voiced ""doubts about Dominique Strauss-Kahn's suitability for running an international institution,"" according to the person, who declined to be identified, citing the sensitivity of the matter. The New York Times published an excerpt of the letter, along with an account that said Strauss-Kahn had aggressively pursued Nagy, sent her sexually explicit messages and once had her summoned from the bathroom to speak to him. The scandal comes at a delicate time for the IMF, which is trying to shore up teetering economies in Europe. The IMF is an immensely powerful agency that loans money to countries to stabilize the world economy. In exchange it often imposes strict austerity measures. Strauss-Kahn seemed to anticipate that his problems with women could be a political liability ahead of France's presidential elections. The French daily newspaper Liberation reported this week that at a meeting with Strauss-Kahn in April, he speculated that his presidential campaign might be subjected to low blows over ""money, women and my Jewishness."" ""Yes, I love women. ... So what?"" the newspaper quoted him as saying. Strauss-Kahn also theorized that his enemies might try to pay someone to accuse him of rape, according to the newspaper. The Associated Press does not name victims of alleged sex crimes unless they agree to it. But in the days since the alleged attack in Manhattan, details are beginning to emerge about Strauss-Kahn's accuser. The woman came to the United States under ""very difficult circumstances"" in 2004 from Guinea, one of the world's most destitute countries, said Shapiro, her lawyer. Guinea's average annual income of $1,000 per person is lower than Haiti's and Rwanda's and about the same as Afghanistan's, according to the CIA World Factbook. The woman's daughter, then 8, came with her. The girl's father is dead, and they have no other relatives in the United States, Shapiro said. ""They are very much alone in this world,"" he said. The United States gave the pair political asylum, he said, though he was unsure of the reason. The woman found work as a chambermaid in hotels, he said, eventually landing a job in 2008 at the French-owned Sofitel Hotel on 44th Street in Manhattan. The hotel said she was a satisfactory employee. ""I would characterize her as a woman of great integrity, dignity, no pretense, of simple and basic values, and with no agenda other than to live and support her daughter and see her daughter do well in this country,"" Shapiro said. The woman and her daughter moved into an apartment building in the Bronx about 10 months ago, said Zulema Zuniga, who lives on the same floor. The neighbors would occasionally meet in the elevator and say hello. ""She was very nice,"" Zuniga said. But this humble immigrant life was shattered, police say, on Saturday afternoon, when the woman entered Strauss-Kahn's suite at the Sofitel to clean the room. Strauss-Kahn came out of the bathroom naked, chased her down a hallway and pulled her into a bedroom, the woman told police. Then he dragged her into a bathroom, forced her to perform oral sex on him and tried to remove her underwear, she said. She broke free, fled the room and told hotel security, but Strauss-Kahn was gone by the time detectives arrived, authorities said. They arrested him soon afterward on an airliner that was just about to depart for Europe. Brafman said he is confident his client will be exonerated once all the physical evidence is collected. Shapiro, a personal injury attorney, said he was put in touch with the woman through a mutual acquaintance. He said he was advising her for free and would play no role in the criminal case, which is being handled by government prosecutors. He said they had not discussed the possibility of a civil lawsuit against Strauss-Kahn. Media attention has made it impossible for his client to return to her house or to work, Shapiro said. This week television crews and photographers hung around the employee entrance of the Sofitel and loitered outside her apartment, hoping for a glimpse of her. ""The reporters are everywhere. They've been ringing my bell all day long,"" said Isidore Adams, a neighbor. Shapiro said his client is now in a ""safe place,"" but would not elaborate. ""Her life has now been turned upside down,"" Shapiro said. ""She can't go home, she can't go back to work. She has no idea what her future will be, what she will be able to do to support herself and her daughter. This has been nothing short of a cataclysmic event in her life."""
21	Forex Week in Review May 15-20	"Below are some of the highlights of the week: EUROPE - IMF names John Lipsky as interim Managing Director - EUR headline inflation was unrevised at +2.8%, y/y, last month, but core-inflation surprised to the upside to +1.6%, y/y.
Headline inflation accelerated to +4.5%, y/y and core CPI jumped to +3.7% from +3.2%, y/y, in March, a new record high.
The claimant count unemployment increased slightly to +4.6%, but the ILO unemployment was down to +7.7% from +7.8%."	"Developments with respect to Greece remain a source of stress for the markets. How will Greece find the €27bn it needs to fill its 2012 ‘funding gap’? Restructure, reprofiling? The market is trying to shape word definitions rather that reshape a quicker market solution for Greece. Before you know it we will have created a Lehman style contagion affair. Today’s Euro pullback appears to have been prompted by pre-weekend nervousness on peripheral finance issues and reports of heavy liquidation in Greek bonds that have coincided with the Spanish/Bund spread blowing out. It’s your typical ‘buy the rumor sell the fact’. It’s easy to create a lot of noise when liquidity is non existent on a Friday. Below are some of the highlights of the week: EUROPE - IMF names John Lipsky as interim Managing Director - EUR headline inflation was unrevised at +2.8%, y/y, last month, but core-inflation surprised to the upside to +1.6%, y/y. Together with strong GDP numbers last week this clearly argues for further ECB tightening. - Rightmove data showed UK property asking prices rising +1.3% this month, to the highest level since June 2008. - Eurogroup chair Juncker conceded that Greek debt is currently at unsustainable levels and said that Europe would consider ‘reprofiling’ of Greek maturities, though only in the context of more spending cuts and asset sales from the Greek government. - UK inflation, both headline and core, surprised to the upside last month. Headline inflation accelerated to +4.5%, y/y and core CPI jumped to +3.7% from +3.2%, y/y, in March, a new record high. Much of the spike was caused by airfare prices, up +36%, y/y. - The letter from BoE Governor King to the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer again downplayed the above-target inflation. King continued to expect, in line with the inflation report, CPI to return back to target with the Bank rate moving in line with market interest rates. - German ZEW economic sentiment was on the weak side, printing at 3.1 in May, down from 7.6 in April and continues the downward trend since February. The ZEW current situation assessment increased to 91.5 from 87.1. - The BoE May minutes showed no change in the voting pattern despite some expectations of one less member supporting a hike. As at the last meeting, Weale and Dale voted for a +25bps hike and Sentance voted for a +50bps hike. - UK jobless claims printed higher than expected at +12.4k vs. the flat consensus forecasted. The claimant count unemployment increased slightly to +4.6%, but the ILO unemployment was down to +7.7% from +7.8%. - Strauss-Kahn resigns from IMF, France’s Lagarde possible successor. - FT Deutschland reported that the ECB might cease to accept Greek sovereign debt if maturities were extended. Board-member Stark was quoted making similar comments at a public forum in Athens. - UK retail sales surprised with a strong +1.2%, m/m read ex-gas, above the +0.8% forecast. It was the strongest increase in over a year, - Spain-Germany 10-year spread exceeds April wides. Americas - Russia’s central bank (CBR) reported in its annual report that its previously disclosed increase in allocation to the CAD in 2010 came at the expense of the GBP, rather than lowering allocation to EUR or USD. - Empire State manufacturing index extended its gains for a sixth-consecutive month (11.9 vs. 20.7), but at its slowest pace this year. - Despite a weaker than expected TIC’s data (+24b vs. +57.7b), overseas demand remains relatively strong. China was seen as a net seller of US treasuries in March. - Governor Carney stated that recent Canadian economic data continues to support the BoC’s near term outlook, noting that employment and inflation numbers were modestly stronger, while auto-sales and retail spending were a touch weaker. The Bank next meets on May 31st to determine their interest rate policy. - US home construction fell unexpectedly in April, an indication that the troubled housing sector will remain a drag on ‘the’ recovery. Construction of homes plummeted -10.6% from March to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of +523k. - US building permits came in weaker, falling to +551k from a downward revision of +574k in March. - US manufacturing production fell for the first time in ten-months (+0.0%) last month, as Japans natural disaster disrupted the auto-industry. Industries used +76.9% of their capacity vs. a +77% reading in March. Manufacturing capacity utilization dropped -0.4% to +74.4%, ex-autos, then factory production gained +0.2% in April. - In the FOMC minutes there was little different to what Bernanke commented in his post press appearance. The FOMC meeting showed that monetary policy tightening is still far down the line. Concerns about inflation were present, but with the dominating view still being rising energy costs are ‘transitory’. - Canadian wholesale trade was weighed down by lower import prices (+0.1% vs. +1.2%) which provided for a disappointing report. - US jobless claims fell for a second consecutive week (-29k to +409k), a tentative sign that the downward trend may have recommenced. The decline is being attributed to the ‘shake out of weather related problems, and supply shortages in Japan - US home resale’s unexpectedly declined last month on widespread weakness (+5.05m vs. +5.20m), despite a downward revision to the previous month and the second contraction in three-months. What is also disturbing is that the month’s supply moved back above 9 (highest print in six months). - For a second consecutive month the Philly Fed manufacturing index plummeted, falling from +18.5 to +3.9 in May. - Canadian retail sales disappointed -0.1% and Canadian inflation numbers came in softer with CPI +0.3% vs. +1.1% ASIA - Japan core-machinery orders rose +2.9% in March, well above consensus expectations for an earthquake-induced 10% decline. This marks the third consecutive month of increased three-month momentum, but seems unlikely to fully reflect the impact from the mid-March earthquake. - Australia reported that the number of home loans contracted -1.5%, m/m, in March, vs. expectation of a +2.0% rebound, to below +45k (weakest number in ten years). However, investment lending rose +2.1%, almost offsetting the -2.3%, m/m, contraction in February. - RBA May minutes said that an appreciating AUD was helping to contain inflation pressures. However, the minutes also noted that higher interest rates may be required at some point if inflation was to remain consistent with medium-term goals. - Australia reported weaker than expected wage cost growth in Q1 of +0.8%, q/q, vs. +1.1% expected. - New Zealand input and output PPI rose to +2.2% and +1.7%, q/q, respectively. Consumer confidence rose to 103.2 from 101.4 in March, arresting the slide in confidence year-to-date. - Japan Q1 GDP fell by -0.9%, q/q, weaker than the -0.5% consensus. The decline was even larger when taking into account that Q4 GDP growth was revised down to -0.8% from -0.3%, q/q, previously. This would suggest an increasing divergence in BoJ and other G10 monetary policy. - New Zealand reported a larger budget surplus projection than the previous forecast easing concerns of sovereign rating downgrades. - BoJ left their monetary policy and its asset purchase plan unchanged. Stable BoJ policy leaves the yen vulnerable as US front-end rates rise. WEEK AHEAD - Heads up for inflation and expectation reports from New Zealand and the UK - We get revised and preliminary GDP releases from the UK and US - Witness borrowing and expenditure data from the UK and Australia - Economic and business indicators from the German ifo and KOF in Switzerland - The US will deliver the volatile New Home Sales at the beginning of the week and we shut out the week with US Pending Home Sales"
22	New York maid to testify in rape case against Dominique Strauss-Kahn	"Asked whether the woman would testify, lawyer Jeff Shapiro told NBC television: ""I believe it will take place today, yes.
And seeking to counter claims of an elaborate set up against the head of the International Monetary Fund, he said she only learned the identity of her alleged attacker a day after the assault in the Sofitel hotel in New York.
""She is prepared to do whatever she is asked to do, which is to cooperate with the New York City police department, the district attorney's office - hours and hours of involvement,"" Shapiro said."	"Asked whether the woman would testify, lawyer Jeff Shapiro told NBC television: ""I believe it will take place today, yes."" He confirmed the 32-year-old woman at the centre of the explosive sex scandal was originally from Guinea. And seeking to counter claims of an elaborate set up against the head of the International Monetary Fund, he said she only learned the identity of her alleged attacker a day after the assault in the Sofitel hotel in New York. ""There is nothing consensual about what took place in that hotel room,"" Shapiro stressed. ""I think that when the jury hears her testimony and sees her in person, and finally she can come public with this and tell her story, I think that (they will find) their claims of consensual sex or encounters are not true."" Start of sidebar. Skip to end of sidebar. End of sidebar. Return to start of sidebar. The woman has not been identified, but Shapiro told NBC that she is ready to fully cooperate with prosecutors in building the case against Strauss-Kahn. Police cut out a piece of carpet from a hotel room in a search for DNA evidence in the attempted-rape case, officials told The Associated Press. New York Police Department detectives and prosecutors believe the carpet may contain Strauss-Khan's semen spat onto the carpet after an episode of forced oral sex, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. They were also looking at the woman's hotel key-card to determine whether she used it to enter the room, and for how long she was there. The second official said that the DNA testing was being ""fast-tracked,"" but that the results could still be a few days away. The two officials spoke on condition of anonymity because neither was authorised to speak about the case publicly, and because it has gone to a grand jury. Strauss-Kahn's lawyers, who have promised a ""vigorous"" defence, suggested at a bail hearing on Monday that it may have been a consensual sexual encounter. The IMF chief denies seven counts of sexual assault and unlawful imprisonment. Defence lawyer Benjamin Brafman said in court that the evidence ""will not be consistent with a forcible encounter."" Prosecutors, however, say they have physical evidence indicating attempted rape, including a doctor's exam made immediately after the incident. ""She's been in a whirlwind since this has taken place,"" Shapiro said, adding that the woman was now being held ""in a safe place"" with her 15-year-old daughter. ""She feels she can't go home. She feels she's been excised from her life,"" he said, revealing that after she returned home from being questioned by police she found a barrage of media outside her house. The woman was ""scared, incredulous"" and ""doesn't know what her future will bring,"" he added. ""What the world has to understand is she came from a part of the world where laws were few and far between. Justice wasn't readily available, at least to people without means,"" Shapiro added. ""That's why she's grateful to be in the United States. Nonetheless when she found out this encounter was with a man of great power and wealth she fears for herself and for her daughter."" A grand jury is due to decide whether there is enough evidence in the accusations to proceed to trial, with its decision set to be unveiled at Friday's next hearing for the head of the International Monetary Fund. ""She is prepared to do whatever she is asked to do, which is to cooperate with the New York City police department, the district attorney's office - hours and hours of involvement,"" Shapiro said. ""She doesn't have an agenda. She's doing this because she believes it is her responsibility to do so, and she will do that."" AFP, AP"

Germany and other European countries are pre-emptively insisting a European should head the fund, the custom since World War II, given that the eurozone debt crisis is the fund's central issue."	"BERLIN Europe is moving quickly to protect its traditional claim to the top job at the IMF ahead of the expected departure of current chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn, resisting a push from developing countries to appoint someone from another region. Strauss-Kahn remains jailed in New York after his arrest for allegedly sexually assaulting a hotel maid, and his departure is expected to be only a matter of time. Germany and other European countries are pre-emptively insisting a European should head the fund, the custom since World War II, given that the eurozone debt crisis is the fund's central issue. But many developing nations note that because of their increasing wealth and role in the global economy, they should have a chance to name the successor. German government spokesman Christoph Steegmans said Wednesday that Strauss-Kahn was entitled to presumption of innocence but ""if the top job at the IMF does have to be filled at some point, then the government argues that there should again be a European at the top of the IMF."" Strauss-Kahn's arrest has put new focus on the informal arrangement under which a European heads the IMF and an American the World Bank. Europeans are citing the IMF's key role in fighting the eurozone's debt crisis as a reason to name someone from the region -- with expertise in its issues and the politics. The IMF has contributed to bailout loans for Greece, Ireland and Portugal and is playing an important part in monitoring those countries' compliance with the loan conditions. South Africa's finance minister, however, said that a new IMF chief should come from a developing nation to reflect the interests of all countries. ""It is against this background that South Africa calls for a candidate from a developing country to be given the opportunity to be the Managing Director of the IMF,"" Pravin Gordhan said in a statement. ""Such a candidate will bring a new perspective that will ensure that the interests of all countries, both developed and developing, are fully reflected in the operations and policies of the IMF."" U.S. Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner said Tuesday that Strauss-Kahn is ""obviously not in a position"" to run the IMF and that the organization needs to find an interim managing director. The United States has a major say in determining who will head the IMF, in part because it holds the largest number of votes at the 187-nation international lending agency. Changes to the IFM's governance in 2008 and last year will shift 5.3 percent of voting share to emerging and developing countries, but all the changes have not taken effect yet. Germany's Steegmans said at a government press briefing that Europe has ""an abundance of highly qualified candidates."" Steegmans didn't name any potential candidates or say whether Germany itself might propose one. But he said it ""makes a lot of sense"" to have an IMF chief who is ""very familiar"" with ""Europe's particularities, the currency questions and also the political circumstances here."" Chancellor Angela Merkel has made the same point, along with several European finance ministers. Possible candidates mentioned in news media speculation include French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde; the former head of the German central bank, Axel Weber; the head of Europe's bailout fund, Klaus Regling; and Peer Steinbrueck, a former German finance minister. Candidates from elsewhere include Turkey's former finance minister, Kemal Dervis; Singapore's finance chief Tharman Shanmugaratnam; and Indian economist Montek Singh Ahluwalia. Yet more possibilities include Trevor Manuel, South Africa's former finance minister; Mexico's central bank governor, Agustin Carstens; former Brazilian central bank president Arminio Fraga; and China's Min Zhu, a special adviser to Strauss-Kahn."

"Socialists Ahead In Poll for 2012 French Presidential Election PARIS -(Dow Jones)- A poll Thursday showed that the socialists Francois Hollande and Martine Aubry currently lead voting preferences ahead of incumbent French president Nicolas Sarkozy. The poll conducted on Wednesday by Ifop-Logica Business Consulting found that 29% of the 1,014 people questioned would vote for the Socialist Party's Francois Hollande if the first election round were to take place this coming Sunday. If Martine Aubry, the Socialist Party's general secretary, was the party's candidate, she would score 27% of the votes if she were to run in the election. In a similar poll last week, Hollande was getting 26% and Aubry 25%. The Socialist Party plans to hold the primary election in October. Hollande has already announced he will run for the primary, while Aubry has kept silent so far. According to the poll, President Nicolas Sarkozy would score 21% of the votes if he were to run against Aubry and 19% of the votes against Hollande. If no candidates secures 50% of votes in the first round of voting in May 2012, a second round between the two most-voted will be held. Far right party leader Marine Le Pen would come in at 17% in both cases.

25	"Strauss-Kahn out on $1 million bail, under home detention"	": Dominique Strauss-Kahn was granted bail by a New York judge Thursday, and the former IMF chief has vowed to fight charges that he tried to rape a hotel maid in Manhattan.
Strauss-Kahn, a man accustomed to luxury hotel suites and first-class plane travel, had been denied bail in Manhattan Criminal Court Monday and has spent the past three nights in New York City’s notorious Rikers Island jail."	"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON D.C.: Dominique Strauss-Kahn was granted bail by a New York judge Thursday, and the former IMF chief has vowed to fight charges that he tried to rape a hotel maid in Manhattan. New York State Supreme Court Judge Michael Obus set bail for Strauss-Kahn, 62, at $1 million, and placed him under 24-hour home detention with electronic monitoring – conditions that had been proposed by his lawyers. The judge also said Strauss-Kahn must have one armed guard at all times at his own expense and have a $5 million insurance bond. Strauss-Kahn was to spend Thursday night in custody, with the bail package due to be signed Friday. His wife, French television journalist Anne Sinclair, and his daughter Camille Strauss-Kahn had arrived at the court arm in arm. Strauss-Kahn arrived in court looking tired and was wearing a blue shirt, no tie, and a gray jacket. Strauss-Kahn, a man accustomed to luxury hotel suites and first-class plane travel, had been denied bail in Manhattan Criminal Court Monday and has spent the past three nights in New York City’s notorious Rikers Island jail. He was detained by New York police Saturday aboard an Air France flight minutes before it was to depart for Paris. Prosecutors said that about 12 p.m. Saturday, Strauss-Kahn had sexually assaulted a maid at the Sofitel hotel in midtown Manhattan, attempted to rape her and then, when unsuccessful, forced her to perform oral sex on him. Thursday’s hearing came as the jockeying to replace him at the top of the IMF intensified. European states and the United States sought a speedy succession to prevent a bid by emerging economies to put a potential rival candidate in place. U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner called for an “open process” to find a successor but sources in Washington said the United States, the largest financial contributor to the IMF, would back a European for the post. Strauss-Kahn’s Saturday arrest also dashed his prospects of running for the French presidency in 2012. His resignation letter, released by the IMF and dated May 18, contained his first public comment on the charges of attempted rape, illegal sexual acts and sequestration of a 32-year-old widow from West Africa at a luxury Manhattan hotel. “I deny with the greatest possible firmness all of the allegations that have been made against me,” he wrote. “I want to devote all my strength, all my time, and all my energy to proving my innocence.” A senior source at the IMF said Strauss-Kahn had resigned on his own accord through lawyers before the Fund’s board had been able to contact him to ask his intentions. The woman Strauss-Kahn allegedly tried to rape testified Wednesday before a grand jury. The 23-member panel will decide in secret whether there is enough evidence to formally press charges with an indictment. Any trial could be six months or more away. If convicted, he could face 25 years in prison. His lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, told his arraignment hearing Monday that the evidence “will not be consistent with a forcible encounter.”"
26	France's Lagarde launches IMF bid	"Lagarde announced her candidacy on the eve of a G8 summit after securing the unanimous backing of the 27-nation European Union and, diplomats said, support from the United States and China, making her the overwhelming favorite to clinch the top job in global finance next month.
European Commission chief Jose Manuel Barroso said Lagarde had the ""indispensable qualities to ensure the IMF's mission and its vital contribution to international economic stability."	"Lagarde announced her candidacy on the eve of a G8 summit after securing the unanimous backing of the 27-nation European Union and, diplomats said, support from the United States and China, making her the overwhelming favorite to clinch the top job in global finance next month. At a news conference in Paris, she promised to serve a full five-year term if chosen, unlike her three predecessors, and to give top priority to completing reform of the International Monetary Fund to give greater weight to emerging economies. ""The emergence of a number of big players like China, India, Brazil and Russia, for example, just to cite a few, forces us to ask ourselves about their representation at the heart of the institution,"" Lagarde said. The 55-year-old former corporate lawyer, who speaks fluent English, has won plaudits for her deft chairing of the G20 finance ministers and communications skills. But unlike Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who resigned last week after being charged with attempted rape, which he denies, Lagarde isn't an economist and may struggle to match his thought leadership over the management of the world economy. European Commission chief Jose Manuel Barroso said Lagarde had the ""indispensable qualities to ensure the IMF's mission and its vital contribution to international economic stability."" The only other declared candidate is Mexican Central Bank Governor Augustin Carstens, but he has not gathered the backing of the main emerging economies. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said both Lagarde and Carstens were very credible candidates. But he reserved most praise for Lagarde, calling her ""an exceptionally capable person, an excellent mix of financial, economic knowledge, talent and the kind of political skills you need."" Mexican Finance Minister Ernesto Cordero said Lagarde had ""all the merits to be appointed at the top of the IMF,"" but Carstens' best credential was the strength of the Mexican economy, which is growing at 5.5 per cent a year. Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa criticized EU officials for suggesting the next IMF head must be a European, a convention that dates back to the founding of the global lender at the end of the Second World War. However, the countries known as the BRICS failed to unite behind a common alternative candidate, leaving the way clear for Lagarde unless she slips on a pending French legal case. Diplomats said their joint statement seemed mostly aimed at securing a public commitment from developed countries that nationality will no longer be a criterion for selecting future IMF chiefs. Russia's ambassador to France, Alexander Orlov, said Moscow was very positive toward Lagarde's candidacy and suggested that in future there should be ""a more just rotation"" between Western Europe and representatives of BRIC countries. Brazil's Finance Minister Guido Mantega welcomed competition for the top job and said his country would seek commitments to give emerging markets more clout at the IMF. Europe is keen to keep the post at a time when the IMF is deeply involved in the euro zone's debt crisis, with joint assistance programs for Greece, Ireland and Portugal."
27	Hotel maid denies HIV claim as fund chief quits	"DOMINIQUE STRAUSS-KAHN, in a New York prison on charges of attempted rape, has resigned from his post as managing director of the International Monetary Fund.
Mr Strauss-Kahn's departure came as Jeffrey Shapiro, the lawyer for the alleged victim, denied his client was HIV-positive.
The woman, a hotel maid, says she was attacked by a naked Mr Strauss-Kahn in his luxury Manhattan suite on Saturday.
The New York Post reported that the pair had lived at addresses rented exclusively to adults with HIV/AIDS and their dependents by a charitable foundation in Harlem."	"DOMINIQUE STRAUSS-KAHN, in a New York prison on charges of attempted rape, has resigned from his post as managing director of the International Monetary Fund. He tendered his letter to the board, expressing his ''infinite sadness'' that he felt ''compelled'' to leave his post, while denying all charges against him. Mr Strauss-Kahn's departure came as Jeffrey Shapiro, the lawyer for the alleged victim, denied his client was HIV-positive. The woman, a hotel maid, says she was attacked by a naked Mr Strauss-Kahn in his luxury Manhattan suite on Saturday. Mr Shapiro rejected US tabloid reports that the 32-year-old west African immigrant lives in housing in the Bronx made available to people with AIDS or HIV. ''Absolutely not,'' he told NBC's Today Show. ''She lived in a sub-let apartment in the Bronx.'' The woman, a widow, lives in the apartment with her teenage daughter. The New York Post reported that the pair had lived at addresses rented exclusively to adults with HIV/AIDS and their dependents by a charitable foundation in Harlem. The woman has accused Mr Strauss-Kahn, who had been seeking a run as the Socialist Party's candidate in the French presidential election next April, of forcing her to perform oral sex on him and then trying to rape her after she inadvertently disturbed him in his suite in the Hotel Sofitel, near Times Square, on Saturday. The woman, who has not been identified by authorities, and other hotel staff are believed to have testified before a grand jury investigating the allegations. The proceedings coincided with Mr Strauss-Kahn's resignation as managing director of the IMF after almost four years. ''I think at this time first of my wife - whom I love more than anything - of my children, of my family, of my friends,'' he said in a statement issued by the IMF. He added: ''To all, I want to say that I deny with the greatest possible firmness all of the allegations that have been made against me. ''I want to protect this institution which I have served with honour and devotion, and especially - especially - I want to devote all my strength, all my time and all my energy to proving my innocence.'' Mr Strauss-Kahn returns to court today for a new bail application in which his lawyers said the 62-year-old was willing to post $US1 million cash as bail and be confined to a location in Manhattan where he would wear an electronic ankle bracelet to monitor his movements. He remained locked up at the notorious Rikers Island prison, where he was sent after being formally charged this week. His lawyers have characterised the case as ''very defensible'', saying the forensic evidence would be inconsistent with a ''forcible encounter''. Reports suggested the defence would argue that any sex act had been consensual. Mr Shapiro said the claims would be exposed as bogus when a jury heard his client's story. ''There is nothing consensual about what took place in that hotel room,'' he said. Mr Strauss-Kahn was hauled off a Paris-bound Air France plane at John F. Kennedy Airport on Saturday afternoon and later charged with a criminal sex act, attempted rape and unlawful imprisonment. Police allege that the executive, who has steered the International Monetary Fund's financial rescue of Europe after the global financial crisis, had dashed to the airport after attacking the maid in his $US3000-a-night suite, leaving behind a mobile phone and other personal belongings in his haste. The maid had alerted hotel security about 1pm, accusing Mr Strauss-Kahn of dragging her along the floor and into a bathroom, where he assaulted her. He then allegedly tried to lock her in the room."
28	French writer who alleged sex attack years ago by Strauss-Kahn delays plan to file complaint	"The comment from David Koubbi, a lawyer for 31-year-old Tristane Banon, in a TV interview came days after he said they were considering a sexual assault complaint against Strauss-Kahn.
""It is absolutely out of the question in the Tristane Banon case that a movement on our part could have as consequence the conviction of Dominique Strauss-Kahn in the United States,"" Koubbi added."	"PARIS - The lawyer for a French writer who alleged former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn had sexually assaulted her eight years ago said Friday she won't file a criminal complaint against him for now. The comment from David Koubbi, a lawyer for 31-year-old Tristane Banon, in a TV interview came days after he said they were considering a sexual assault complaint against Strauss-Kahn. ""Our decision has been reserved for later for a very simple reason: Neither Tristane Banon or I want to be manipulated by the American justice system, or help out in any way so that these two cases might be linked in one way or another,"" he told France's BFM Television. Strauss-Kahn was jailed Saturday after a hotel chambermaid in New York accused him of trying to rape her. He has denied breaking any laws but resigned as International Monetary Fund chief on Thursday. Lawyers posted $1 million bail Friday for Strauss-Kahn as he awaits trial on attempted rape. The 62-year-old Socialist had been seen previously as a possible contender in France's 2012 presidential election. Koubbi said he wants to keep his client's case separate. ""It is absolutely out of the question in the Tristane Banon case that a movement on our part could have as consequence the conviction of Dominique Strauss-Kahn in the United States,"" Koubbi added. ""If Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn is to be convicted in the United States of America, it will be because of events linked to the American case, which I know nothing about, that I haven't seen — and about which it's not my job to address."" Koubbi made headlines Monday by saying on French radio that he and Banon were ""very seriously considering"" a criminal complaint following news that Strauss-Kahn had been arrested. ""Tristane Banon has seen events in her past surge forward with this American echo, and I can tell you she's not surprised about what Dominique Strauss-Kahn is accused of,"" Koubbi said Monday of the New York case. On French TV in 2007, Banon said that during an interview with him years earlier she had wrestled with Strauss-Kahn after he tried to forcibly strip her, and ""it ended very badly."" In the radio interview, Koubbi said that Banon didn't file suit then because she felt ""pressures"" and that her own mother — a regional official from Strauss-Kahn's Socialist Party — had dissuaded her from doing so. The Associated Press is identifying Banon as an alleged victim of sexual assault because she has gone public with her account. In court Monday, Manhattan assistant district attorney John ""Artie"" McConnell said U.S. authorities were working to verify at least one other case of ""conduct similar to the conduct alleged"" by the maid. When a judge asked whether that potential other incident occurred in the United States, McConnell said he ""believed that was abroad"" — but he did not elaborate."

"The now former IMF head Dominique Strauss-Kahn is currently out on bail of $1 million. The Manhattan District Attorney's office was unable to convince the court that he was a flight risk, even though the circumstances of his capture would suggest that the D.A.'s office might have a point. Strauss-Kahn's wife had arranged for housing on the upper east side, but Strauss-Kahn was forced to seek an alternative when the building's residents were made aware of the situation. He is currently being held at his private security firm's corporate housing at 71 Broadway, a short distance from Ground Zero. Stroz Friedberg is charging Strauss-Kahn somewhere in the vicinity of $200,000 per month for their monitoring services. Sources say that not only is the 32-year-old housekeeper at the heart of this story a compelling witness, but that forensic evidence collected from the hotel bears out her tale as well. Her pass key shows that she opened Strauss-Kahn's suite door, but never closed it, which is important in that it shows her intent was to clean the room and not to engage in consensual sex (ABC News ). Other women have come forward with allegations of sexual misconduct by Strauss-Kahn, and in an odd convergence of events, Kristen Davis, the so called Manhattan Madam, has come come forward to say that Strauss-Kahn was not only a client but that one of her ""girls"" alleged that he had been rough and asked that she not be required to see him again (Wall Street Pit ).  Additionally, French women journalists seem to have had an odd relationship with Strauss-Kahn wherein they all knew he would be...well, it appears that they seemed resigned to the fact that he would be inappropriately flirtatious, for lack of a better word.

She can (she must), if she feels a line was crossed, relate it in her newspaper (Monsters & Critics )"". It seems absurd to think that they felt this way, as if Strauss-Kahn's behavior was just a rite of passage, but that seems to be the attitude taken towards him. The IMF is now scrambling to explain how they could have given Strauss-Kahn a contract that appears to give him a $250,000 severance pay. Strauss-Kahn is also due a ""much smaller"" annual pension according to the IMF, but the amount is not as unnerving as the fact that even if he is found guilty on these charges, he will still be entitled to that money (Reuters ).        "
32	From Oswald To Lohan: America Loves A Perp Walk	With the arrest of IMF head Dominique Strauss-Kahn this past weekend also came controversy about one of America's armchair past times: the perp walk.	"With the arrest of IMF head Dominique Strauss-Kahn this past weekend also came controversy about one of America's armchair past times: the perp walk. Everyone from preppy killer Robert Chambers , to Lee Harvey Oswald, Timothy McVeigh, Russell Crowe and countless mafia associates have been put through the strange public ritual. Although perp walk's have been used in the past (see: Oswald), they've become increasingly common in the media-saturated landscape of the last twenty years, especially in white collar criminal cases where they serve as a form of public shaming. And you can thank Mayor of 9/11 Town Rudy Giuliani for that: according to The National Law Journal , he is ""given credit for 'patent[ing] the perp walk' for white-collar defendants during his tenure as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York...When the time came to arrest three prominent Wall Street traders and bankers that his office accused of insider trading, Giuliani directed that the defendants be arrested at their offices, handcuffed and escorted from the building to a mob of press that had been previously alerted. Charges against one of the defendants were dismissed, although damage to his reputation based on the perp walk and media frenzy was irreparable."" Mayor Bloomberg has also defended the practice: ""I think it is humiliating, but you know if you don’t want to do the perp walk, don’t do the crime... Our judicial system works where the public can see the alleged perpetrators."" But what if the perp is later found innocent? Take a look through the gallery above at some other famous perp walks, including Lindsay Lohan, Kenneth Lay and Johnny Depp. Do you think that perp walks are unfair for defendants, or just the right amount of Schadenfreude?

Advertisement: Story continues below Since Strauss-Kahn's resignation last week, Europeans have been moving swiftly to ensure that this position remains their property. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has argued that ''with serious problems with the euro, and the IMF strongly involved [in efforts to resolve Europe's ongoing sovereign debt crisis], there is a lot in favour of a European candidate being put forward''. With all due respect to French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde, who seems to be emerging as the Europeans' preferred candidate, this argument is bogus. It is not as if Europeans have been doing such a stellar job of managing their sovereign debt crisis that being a European would constitute incontrovertible evidence of the skills required to carry out that task. The mire into which Greece has sunk is partly the result of the persistent failure of European institutions to discern the true state of Greek finances, and to insist sooner that previous Greek governments put them in order. Even today, there are deep disagreements between the European Central Bank and European governments, including Germany's, as to whether Greece should be permitted to ''reschedule'' or ''reprofile'' (that is, to default on part of) its outstanding debts. And given that much of the debt owed by Greece, Ireland and Portugal is owed to European (and especially to German, French and British) banks, which might in turn need to be bailed out by their respective governments in the event of a default by Greece, Ireland or Portugal, there might even be grounds for concern that a European with political aspirations beyond his or her term as IMF managing director might be tempted to offer greater financial support to a European government in difficulty than a non-European would do. I certainly do not recall any suggestions that it would have been good to have an Asian heading the IMF during the Asian financial crisis that took place in 1997-98, or that it would have been an advantage to have had a Latin American in charge of the IMF during any of myriad financial crises that have afflicted Latin American countries during the past 30 years. The selection criteria outlined by the IMF's executive board stipulate that the successful candidate will have ''a distinguished record in economic policymaking at senior levels'', an ''outstanding professional background'', ''demonstrated the managerial and diplomatic skills needed to lead a global institution'', ''capable of providing strategic vision for the work of a high-quality, diverse and dedicated staff', ''a proven understanding … of the challenges facing the fund's diverse membership'', ''a firm commitment to, and appreciation of, multilateral co-operation and … a demonstrated capacity to be objective and impartial'', and ''will also be an effective communicator''. Someone who meets all these criteria - but not the unofficial one of being a European - is the immediate past governor of the Reserve Bank, Ian Macfarlane (pictured right). He was in that position for a decade - longer than anyone else, except ''Nugget'' Coombs - after a career that included six years at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris. He certainly has ''a distinguished record in economic policymaking at senior levels''. During his decade at the top of the RBA, there was only one quarter in which the annual underlying inflation rate exceeded the top end of the 2-3 per cent target agreed between the bank and the government at the start of his term. Yet this was not achieved by sacrificing economic growth: there was only one quarter of negative growth on his watch; and the unemployment rate fell from 8.4 per cent, when he became governor, to 4.7 per cent by the time he left it. And while that record was obviously in part shaped by circumstances beyond his control or influence, his preparedness to raise interest rates when necessary (in the face of covert political pressure to refrain from doing so), and willingness to avoid doing so at other times (such as when the Australian dollar fell sharply during the Asian crisis and again during and after the ''tech bubble'') certainly contributed to those outcomes. More importantly, from the standpoint of fulfilling the criteria for IMF managing director, he has had ''hands-on'' experience of dealing with a banking crisis, having been RBA deputy governor in the early 1990s when two state-owned banks failed, and two of the four big private banks came perilously close to a similar fate. Under his leadership, the RBA was one of few in the industrialised world (and the only one among the ''advanced'' members of the G20) not to have made the mistake of leaving interest rates too low for too long in the aftermath of the 2000 ''tech wreck'' and the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. And unlike most of his peers, Macfarlane knew a ''bubble'' when he saw one, in the Australian housing market of 2003-04; and unlike any of them, actually did something about it - by raising interest rates (when most other central banks were still lowering them), and giving a series of explicit warnings about the dangers of excessively leveraged investment in residential property. Macfarlane, with his then deputy Stephen Grenville, was among the first to recognise that the IMF was taking the wrong approach to dealing with the Asian crisis, that raising interest rates aggressively and tightening fiscal policy sharply (which the IMF, under its French managing director, Michel Camdessus, urged Thailand, Korea and Indonesia to do) would worsen the crisis rather than end it. The very different approach that the IMF under Strauss-Kahn has taken to the European sovereign debt crisis has vindicated Macfarlane's judgment. In these pages last week, William Pesek also suggested four highly qualified Asian candidates - Haruhiko Koroda, who has been Asian Development Bank chief since 2004; Sri Mulyani Indrawati, the highly effective Indonesian finance minister from 2005-10; Malaysian central bank governor Zeti Akhtar Aziz; and deputy head of India's Planning Commission Montek Singh Ahluwalia (who has also worked at the IMF). The Europeans and Americans need to realise that they do not run the world economy any more and that appointments should be made on merit, not nationality.

35	Beware the alpha romeos like Arnold Schwarzenegger	"That fuss last month over whether Barack Obama had really been born on American territory raised the issue of Article II of the American constitution.
And spectacularly joining their ranks last week was International Monetary Fund boss Dominique Strauss-Kahn , although he stands accused of having elevated his serial interest in women to criminal activity."	"It seems that you'd be taking a punt marrying an Austrian. The country itself has often displayed a nasty arrogance, in deep denial of its sins. And its famous menfolk are too often created in that same image: there was Adolf Hitler, of course; and then lying racist Kurt Waldheim, who not only once was president of his country but also Secretary General of the United Nations; and now we have Arnold Schwarzenegger. His leadership prospects have been terminated, and not before time. The US will look back soon and wonder how close it came to having the deceitful narcissist muscle in on its national stage. We might have had a US election fought between the son of a Nazi soldier and the son of an untrustworthy, accident-prone Kenyan drunk. Start of sidebar. Skip to end of sidebar. End of sidebar. Return to start of sidebar. It didn't happen, and recently we were reminded why not. That fuss last month over whether Barack Obama had really been born on American territory raised the issue of Article II of the American constitution. It states that ""No person except a natural born Citizen of the United States ... shall be eligible to the Office of President"". Obama turned up last month with his birth certificate - as he has before - and proved his American status. But idiotic and hysterical as conservative American voices so often are, Article II may have saved them from a fate worse than the black man many of them so clearly dread. It wasn't that long ago that the deluded voters of California so loved their Governor - a womanising, bodybuilding actor, perfect qualifications for West Coast leadership - that 65 per cent of them supported him, and a number of influential Americans were calling for the US Constitution to be hurriedly changed so that Arnie might make a run for the White House. One of them was his poor wife Maria Shriver. Part of the Kennedy dynasty, she might have known politics, but she didn't know her man. When some Silicon Valley bigwigs started spending money on the campaign to have her husband for President, Shriver agreed. ""Absolutely"" there should be an amendment to clear the way for Schwarzenegger to run. Syndicated radio host Alex Jones, once a Republican, saw things differently: ""He's a bully and a preening peacock who is totally power-mad,"" he said. ""For God's sake, don't let this megalomaniac become president."" Jones was right. Shriver was wrong. And what a price she has paid - her children growing up in a house alongside their housemaid's son, also Arnie's offspring. By now Shriver must know the absurdly ambitious Schwarzenegger has cunningly manipulated her, probably since they first met in 1977, their relationship starting, of course, when he was deeply involved with another. That he has involved their four children in a dreadful pantomime that will scar their lives would hardly worry the man who is a better actor than anyone could have believed. It didn't start off being about politics, but like so many knuckle-grazing alpha males, it was about power. Mostly over women. The actor now finds himself in league with the actors of other professions; men who want to be taken very seriously for their professional achievements, but whose self-obsessed lives are ruled by the need to conquer women and humiliate them. Disgraced AFL star Wayne Carey is one. How about Tiger Woods? Maybe disgraced former David Jones boss Mark McInnes had just started training. They're everywhere. And spectacularly joining their ranks last week was International Monetary Fund boss Dominique Strauss-Kahn, although he stands accused of having elevated his serial interest in women to criminal activity. An underpaid West African maid at Strauss-Kahn's hotel in Manhattan says he groped and mauled her before trying to rape her. He has been charged with offences that could see him jailed for 74 years. His wife, prominent French TV journalist Anne Sinclair, is standing by her man. Many worthy women stand by their untrustworthy and repugnant partners, at least initially, some staying the distance because of the strategic value. Like Hillary Clinton. Others, like Sally Carey, and Tiger Woods's missus Elin Nordegren, eventually come to their senses. Their men like the idea of a breeding bimbo at home and whatever they like on the road. Of course, they are contemptuous of both. Seems Strauss-Kahn's chances of becoming French president next year have taken a hit. His wife may have been quite looking forward to taking up residency in the Elysee Palace. Now, other women are coming out to say Strauss-Kahn attacked them. Though Strauss-Kahn may be innocent - and insists he is - commonly, these men are following the patterns of a lifetime. Not long ago an AFL footballer was charged with a serious sexual crime. While he protests his innocence, his reported attitude when questioned by the club's football manager might sum up the problems for both men. ""I can get whatever chicks I want. I don't have to rape anyone,"" he said."
36	Accused IMF Rapist’s Electronic Hotel Key May Damn Or Save Him	"Everyone’s used to the ubiquitous swiping hotel key card—but what you might not know is that your key holds a history of every time that door closes.
While the matter of what happened inside—rape or no rape—is disputed, his room’s door has an account that can’t be argued, the New York Times reports : “[The hotel] would have a record of her using the key to gain access,” explains a rep from a hotel key manufacturing firm.
The system can differentiate between the guest’s card key and the housekeeper’s master key."	"Everyone’s used to the ubiquitous swiping hotel key card—but what you might not know is that your key holds a history of every time that door closes . And when you’re accused of raping the maid, this record’s important. Dominique Strauss-Kahn, French (former) head of the IMF, is charged with forcing himself on his maid when she was called to his room for a routine linen job. While the matter of what happened inside—rape or no rape—is disputed, his room’s door has an account that can’t be argued, the New York Times reports : “[The hotel] would have a record of her using the key to gain access,” explains a rep from a hotel key manufacturing firm. “They should have a record of the door remaining open for X period of time, and the door lock being actuated again. The system can differentiate between the guest’s card key and the housekeeper’s master key.” So the key could help piece together the scene. Was the door shut behind the maid at the time she alleges? If so, that’s imprisonment. Was it left open or ajar in accordance with hotel policy? If so, for how long? These mundane door details from a little plastic card might either set Strauss-Kahn free or send him to prison. Photo: sixninepixels/Shutterstock"
37	Dominique Strauss-Kahn says he would wear an electronic monitoring bracelet in order to get bail from Rikers Island	"""I voluntarily waive all extradition proceeding of every kind and character,"" Mr Strauss-Kahn wrote in a sworn statement two days after a judge deemed him a flight risk and denied him bail.
Meanwhile, the lawyer for the woman accusing Mr Strauss-Kahn of rape, Jeff Shapiro, refused to comment on the closed-door proceedings.
Mr Shapiro also shot down the idea that his client had consented to a sexual encounter in Mr Strauss-Kahn's luxury Manhattan hotel room, and suggested forensic evidence would back her up."	"The 62-year-old went to great lengths to assure he would remain in New York, even swearing to waive all rights to extradition. ""I voluntarily waive all extradition proceeding of every kind and character,"" Mr Strauss-Kahn wrote in a sworn statement two days after a judge deemed him a flight risk and denied him bail. The new application describes Mr Strauss-Kahn, who was scolded by the IMF in 2008 for an inappropriate but consensual affair with a then-IMF economist, as ""a loving husband and father, and a highly regarded international diplomat, lawyer, politician, economist and professor, with no criminal record."" In a further bid to establish ties to the United States, the application said his American-born wife, journalist Anne Sinclair, is ""currently working on a book about American political life."" It adds that he has a daughter who lives in New York. The filing includes a copy of the deed for their Washington home. It was bought in late 2007 for $4 million. The application said it was bought by both Mr Strauss-Kahn and Ms Sinclair but the deed is in Ms Sinclair's name only. Despite the offer of $1 million in cash as a guarantee at a hearing Monday, the judge deemed the veteran French politician was a flight risk, pointing to the fact he was escorted off an Air France flight minutes before it was to take off from John F. Kennedy International Airport. France and the United States have no extradition agreement. But Mr Strauss-Kahn's defense team countered that decision in the filing Wednesday, arguing that he did not flee the Sofitel Hotel on Saturday. Mr Strauss-Kahn checked out of the hotel at 12:28 pm (1628 GMT) and ""proceeded to a previously scheduled lunch a few blocks away"" at 12:45 pm (1645 GMT). After lunch, he was driven to the airport for a 4:40 pm (2040 GMT) Paris-bound flight that had been scheduled one week in advance for business meetings that were to begin Sunday in Germany, the lawyers said. They added that Mr Strauss-Kahn ""voluntarily disclosed"" to hotel officials, when he called to inquire about his missing cell phone, that he was at the airport. The judge hearing the new offer on Thursday is different to the one who turned down bail on Monday and refused to reconsider even after lawyer Benjamin Brafman raised the idea of an ankle monitoring bracelet. Meanwhile, the lawyer for the woman accusing Mr Strauss-Kahn of rape, Jeff Shapiro, refused to comment on the closed-door proceedings. He hit back at claims his client was part of an elaborate set-up intended to bring down the head of the International Monetary Fund. Mr Shapiro also shot down the idea that his client had consented to a sexual encounter in Mr Strauss-Kahn's luxury Manhattan hotel room, and suggested forensic evidence would back her up. “All of the forensic evidence in this case has been gathered by the district attorney's office and it's within their control. They have it and I can't comment on it with you unfortunately today,” he told CNN. “There's been a lot of things stated out here of conspiracy theories and various other things and they are not true,” Shapiro said. “The most important thing is for her to be vindicated. She has no other agenda other than to tell the truth and to be able to live her life the way she did before this event took place.” The maid, a 32-year-old from the west African nation of Guinea, who has not been officially identified, contends she only learned the identity of her alleged attacker a day after the assault in the Sofitel hotel in Manhattan. “One day she will be able to walk in court and tell a jury what happened,” Mr Shapiro said. “And when that day comes and the jury tells her story, it will be quite clear that there was no aspect whatsoever about this encounter which was in any way construed as consensual.” The Muslim maid was described by her lawyer as an “observant woman” who had come to the United States “under adverse circumstances” with little education, struggling to make ends meet. Separated for some time from her 15-year-old daughter because of the ordeal, she was doing “remarkably well considering what she's been through,” Mr Shapiro said. “She doesn't know what her future will be. She hasn't been able to get professional help of any sort. She's been subjected to the interrogation... she's had trouble sleeping, had to wear the same clothes for three days. “I have to tell you, I have great, great admiration for her and based upon the hours that I've spent talking to her,” the lawyer added. In addition to examining the Sofitel Hotel suite for further potential DNA evidence, investigators were looking at the maid's keycard to determine whether she used it to enter the room, and how long she was there, officials said. One of the officials said that the DNA testing was being “fast-tracked” but that the results could still be a few days away. AFP/AP"

"German Chancellor Angela Merkel called on emerging powers Thursday to accept a European as the next head of the IMF, citing the lender's role in the euro zone debt crisis and Dominique Strauss-Kahn's early resignation. Speaking at a news conference, Merkel stressed that in general emerging countries had a right to the top job in the IMF or World Bank. ""But I believe that in the current situation, given that we have considerable problems with the euro and that the IMF is very strongly involved here, much can be said for the possibility of installing a European candidate."" ""I am of the opinion that we should propose a European candidate."" Strauss-Kahn resigned as head of the International Monetary Fund Wednesday, saying he needed to devote all his energy to fight charges that he sexually assaulted a hotel maid. His exit sparked debate over the 65-year-old tradition that a European is appointed as head of the Washington-based lender. ""We must also account for the fact that Mr Strauss-Kahn's time in office was not completed,"" Merkel added. ""That means that the change is taking place within this period of office, and I believe that could be an argument perhaps for the emerging countries to consider."" She said a successor would have to be found quickly. Page 1 of 2 | Next Page Show Entire Article"
40	Rescuers race to find survivors of Joplin tornado	"It was the nation's deadliest single twister in nearly 60 years and the second major tornado disaster in less than a month.
Unlike the multiple storms that killed more than 300 people last month across the South, Joplin was smashed by just one exceptionally powerful tornado.
That storm also killed 116, according to the National Weather Service.
As the tornado bore down on their trailer home, Joshua Wohlford, his pregnant girlfriend and their two toddlers fled to a Walmart store."	"It was the nation's deadliest single twister in nearly 60 years and the second major tornado disaster in less than a month. Authorities feared the toll could rise as the full scope of the destruction comes into view: house after house reduced to slabs, cars crushed like soda cans, shaken residents roaming streets in search of missing family members. And the danger was by no means over. Fires from gas leaks burned across town, and more violent weather loomed, including the threat of hail, high winds and even more tornadoes. At daybreak, the city's south side emerged from darkness as a barren, smoky wasteland. ""I've never seen such devastation — just block upon block upon block of homes just completely gone,"" said former state legislator Gary Burton who showed up to help at a volunteer center at Missouri Southern State University. Unlike the multiple storms that killed more than 300 people last month across the South, Joplin was smashed by just one exceptionally powerful tornado. Not since a June 1953 tornado in Flint, Mich., had a single twister been so deadly. That storm also killed 116, according to the National Weather Service. Authorities were prepared to find more bodies in the rubble throughout this gritty, blue-collar town of 50,000 people about 160 miles south of Kansas City. Gov. Jay Nixon told The Associated Press he did not want to guess how high the death toll would eventually climb. But he said: ""Clearly, it's on its way up."" Seventeen people were pulled alive from the rubble. An unknown number of people were hurt. While many residents had up to 17 minutes of warning, rain and hail may have drowned out the sirens. Larry Bruffy said he heard the first warning but looked out from his garage and saw nothing. ""Five minutes later, the second warning went off,"" he said. ""By the time we tried to get under the house, it already went over us."" As rescuers toiled in the debris, a strong thunderstorm lashed the crippled city. Rescue crews had to move gingerly around downed power lines and jagged chunks of debris as they hunted for victims and hoped for survivors. Fires, gas fumes and unstable buildings posed constant threats. Teams of searchers fanned out in waves across several square miles. The groups went door to door, making quick checks of property that in many places had been stripped to their foundations or had walls collapse. National Weather Service Director Jack Hayes said the storm was given a preliminary label as an EF4 — the second-highest rating assigned to twisters based on the damage they cause. Hayes said the storm had winds of 190 to 198 mph. At times, it was three-quarters of a mile wide. Some of the most startling damage was at St. John's Regional Medical Center, where staff had only moments to hustle their patients into the hallway. Six people died there, five of them patients, plus one visitor. The storm blew out hundreds of windows and caused damage so extensive that doctors had to abandon the hospital soon after the twister passed. A crumpled helicopter lay on its side in the parking lot near a single twisted mass of metal that used to be cars. Dr. Jim Riscoe said some members of his emergency room staff showed up after the tornado with injuries of their own, but they worked through the night anyway. ""I spent most of my life at that hospital,"" Roscoe said at a triage center at Joplin's Memorial Hall entertainment venue. ""It's awful. I had two pregnant nurses who dove under gurneys ... It's a testimony to the human spirit."" Once the center of a thriving mining industry, Joplin flourished though World War II because of its rich lead and zinc mines. It also gained fame as a stop along Route 66, the storied highway stretching from Chicago to Santa Monica, Calif., before freeways diminished the city's importance. The community, named for the founder of the area's first Methodist congregation, is now a transportation crossroads and manufacturing hub. It's also the hometown of poet Langston Hughes and ""Gunsmoke"" actor Dennis Weaver. Major employers in and around the city include electronics manufacturer LaBarge Inc., colleges such as Missouri Southern State University and hospitals and clinics. Agriculture is also important to the economy. As the tornado bore down on their trailer home, Joshua Wohlford, his pregnant girlfriend and their two toddlers fled to a Walmart store. The family narrowly escaped after a shelf of toys partially collapsed, forming a makeshift tent that shielded them. ""It was 15 minutes of hell,"" Wohlford said. At a Fast Trip convenience store, another 20 people ran into a pitch-black cooler as the building began to collapse around them. They documented their experience with a video that was drawing tens of thousands of views online by Monday afternoon. The audio was even more terrifying than the imagery — earsplitting wind, objects getting smashing, wailing children and a woman praying repeatedly. Brennan Stebbins said the group crouched on the floor, clinging to and comforting each other until they were able to crawl out. No one was seriously hurt. Shielded by mattresses, former lawmaker Chuck Surface rode out the storm in his basement with his wife, daughter, granddaughter and dog. After about five minutes, the deafening roar abruptly stopped. ""When it got to where we thought we could look out,"" he said, ""we went to the top of the stairs and there was no roof — it was all open air."" Dazed survivors tried to salvage clothes, furniture, family photos and financial records from their flattened or badly damaged homes. Kelley Fritz rummaged briefly through what was left of a storage building, then gave up. Her boys, both Eagle Scouts, rushed into the neighborhood after realizing every home was destroyed. When they returned, she said, ""my sons had deceased children in their arms."" Others just waited for answers. Justin Gibson stood outside the tangled remains of a Home Depot and pointed to a black pickup that had been tossed into them. It belonged to his roommate's brother, last seen at the store with his two young daughters. ""I don't know the extent of this yet,"" Gibson said, ""but I know I'll have friends and family dead."" Last month, a ferocious pack of twisters roared across six Southern states, killing more than 300 people, more than two-thirds of them in Alabama. As in the Midwest, the Southerners also had warning — as much as 24 minutes. But those storms were too wide and too powerful to escape. They obliterated entire towns from Tuscaloosa, Ala., to Bristol, Va., in what the weather service said was the nation's deadliest tornado outbreak since April 1974. ""This was one tornado,"" said Greg Carbin, warning specialist with the Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Okla. ""It was not the same type of large-scale outbreak."" It did, however, get the attention of those who suffered in the South. ""We're praying for those people,"" said retired Marine Willie Walker, whose Tuscaloosa home suffered more than $50,000 in damage. ""We know what they're going through because we've been there already."" Forecasters said severe weather would probably persist all week. Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma could see tornadoes through Tuesday, and the bad weather could reach the East Coast by Friday. The twister that hit Joplin was one of more than 50 reported across seven Midwest states over the weekend. One person was killed in Minneapolis and another in Kansas, but Missouri took the hardest hits. Triage centers and shelters around Joplin rapidly filled to capacity. At a Lowe's home-improvement store, wooden planks served as cots. Kerry Sachetta, principal of a flattened Joplin High School, could barely recognize his own building. ""You see pictures of World War II, the devastation and all that with the bombing,"" he said. ""That's really what it looked like."" ___ Associated Press Writer David A.

41	Regime Change at the IMF: The Frame-Up of Dominique Strauss-Kahn?	"[Forward this article on Facebook or twitter, click above] The arrest of IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn has all the appearances of a frame-up ordered by powerful members of the financial establishment, in liaison with France's Nicolas Sarkozy, whose presidency has served the interests of the US at the expense of those of France and the European Union."	"[Forward this article on Facebook or twitter, click above] The arrest of IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn has all the appearances of a frame-up ordered by powerful members of the financial establishment, in liaison with France's Nicolas Sarkozy, whose presidency has served the interests of the US at the expense of those of France and the European Union. While there is for the moment no proof of a plot, the unusual circumstances of his arrest and imprisonment require careful examination. Immediately following Strauss Kahn's arrest, pressures were exerted by Washington to speed up his replacement as Managing Director of the IMF preferably by a non-European, an American or a handpicked candidate from an ""emerging market economy"" or a developing country. Since the founding of the Bretton Woods institutions in 1945, the World Bank has been headed by an American whereas the IMF has been under the helm of a (Western) European. Strauss-Kahn is a member of elite groups who meet behind closed doors. He belongs to the Bildeberger. Categorized as one of the world's most influential persons, he is an academic and politician rather than a banker. In contrast to his predecessors at the IMF, he has no direct affiliation to a banking or financial institution. But at the same time he is the fall guy. His ""gaffe"" was to confront the Washington-Wall Street Consensus and push for reforms within the IMF, which challenged America's overriding role within the organization. The demise of Strauss-Kahn potentially serves to strengthen the hegemony of the US and its control over the IMF at the expense of what former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld called ""Old Europe"". Blocking Strauss-Kahn, the Presidential Candidate In recent years, a major shift has occurred in Europe's political landscape. Pro-American governments have been elected in both France and Germany. Social Democracy has been weakened. Franco-American relations have been redefined, with Washington playing a significant role in grooming a new generation of European politicians. The presidency of Nicolas Sarkozy has, in many regards, become a de facto US ""client regime"", broadly supportive of US corporate interests in the EU and closely aligned with US foreign policy. There are two overlapping and interrelated issues in the DSK frame-up hypothesis. The first pertains to regime change at the IMF, the second to Strauss-Kahn as a candidate in France's forthcoming presidential elections. Both these processes are tied into the clash between competing US and European economic interests. Strauss-Khan as a favorite of the Socialist Party, would have won the presidential elections leading to the demise of ""Our Man in Paris"" Nicolas Sarkozy. As documented by Thierry Meyssan, the CIA played a central undercover role in destabilizing the Gaullist party and supporting the election of Nicolas Sarkozy (See Operation Sarkozy: How the CIA placed one of its agents at the presidency of the French Republic, Reseau Voltaire , September 4, 2008) A Strauss-Kahn presidency and a ""Socialist"" government would have been a serious setback for Washington, contributing to a major shift in Franco-American relations. It would also have contributed to weakening America's role on the European political chessboard. It would also have changed the balance of power between America and ""Old Europe"" (namely the Franco-German alliance). It would have had repercussions on the internal structure of the Atlantic Alliance and the hegemonic role of the US within NATO. The Frame-Up? Fifty-seven percent of France's population, according to a May 17 poll, believe that Strauss-Kahn was framed, victim of a set-up. He was detained on alleged sexual assault and rape charges based on scanty evidence. He was detained based on a complaint filed by the Sofitel hotel where he was staying, on behalf of the alleged victim, an unnamed hotel chamber-maid: The 32-year-old maid told authorities that she entered his suite early Saturday afternoon and he attacked her, New York Police Department spokesman Paul J. Browne. She said she had been told to clean the spacious $3,000-a-night suite, which she thought was empty. According to an account the woman provided to police, Strauss-Kahn emerged from the bathroom naked, chased her down a hallway and pulled her into a bedroom, where he began to sexually assault her. She said she fought him off, then he dragged her into the bathroom, where he forced her to perform oral sex on him and tried to remove her underwear. The woman was able to break free again and escaped the room and told hotel staff what had happened, authorities said. They called police. http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/business/7565485.html#ixzz1MfFWFlnY (Wednesday CFR.org Roundup: U.S. pressures Strauss-Kahn to resign) Challenging the Washington Consensus What is at stake in the immediate wake of Strauss Kahn's demise is ""regime change"" at the IMF. The Obama administration has demanded his replacement by a more compliant individual. U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, former CEO of the New York Federal Reserve Bank is pushing for the replacement of Dominique Strauss-Kahn, ""suggesting he can no longer perform his duties"" as IMF Managing director. ""Geithner called for greater formal recognition by the IMF board that John Lipsky, the fund's second-in-command, will continue serving as temporary managing director for an interim period. Although Strauss-Kahn has yet to resign, sources say the IMF is in touch with his legal counsel to discuss his future at the organization."" What lies behind the frame-up scenario? What powerful interests are involved? Geithner had a close personal relationship with Strauss-Kahn. On the floor of the US Senate (May 18), Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois, called for the resignation of DSK while calling upon the IMF's deputy managing director John Lipsky to ""assume full responsibility of the IMF"" as interim managing director. The process of ""permanent replacement should ""commence at once,"" he said. John Lipsky is a well connected Wall Street banker, a former Vice Chairman at JPMorgan Investment Bank. While the IMF is in theory an intergovernmental organization, it has historically been controlled by Wall Street and the US Treasury. The IMF's ""bitter economic medicine"", the so-called Structural Adjustment Program (SAP), imposed on countless developing countries, essentially serves the interests of creditor banks and multinational corporations. The IMF is not the main architect of these devastating economic reforms which have served to impoverish millions of people, while creating a ""favorable environment"" for foreign investors in Third World low wage economies. The creditor banks call the shots. The IMF is a bureaucratic entity. Its role is to implement and enforce those economic policies on behalf of dominant economic interests. Strauss Kahn's proposed reforms while providing a ""human face"" to the IMF did not constitute a shift in direction. They were formulated within the realm of neoliberalism. They modified but they did not undermine the central role of IMF ""economic medicine"". The socially devastating impacts of IMF ""shock treatment"" under Strauss-Kahn's leadership have largely prevailed. Dominique Strauss Kahn arrived at the helm of the IMF in November 2007, less than a year prior to September-October 2008 financial meltdown on Wall Street. The structural adjustment program (SAP) was not modified. Under DSK, IMF ""shock treatment"" which historically had been limited to developing countries was imposed on Greece, Ireland and Portugal. Under the helm of DSK as Managing Director, the IMF demanded that developing countries remove food and fuel subsidies at a time of rising commodity prices on the New York and Chicago Mercantile exchanges. The hikes in food and fuel prices, which preceded the September-October 2008 Wall Street crash, were in large part the result of market manipulation. Grain prices were boosted artificially by large scale speculative operations. Instead of taming the speculators and containing the rise in food and fuel prices, the IMF's role was to ensure that the governments of indebted developing countries would not in any way interfere in the ""free market"", by preventing these prices from going up. These hikes in food prices, which are the result of outright manipulation (rather than scarcity) have served to impoverish people Worldwide. The surge in food prices constitutes a new phase of the process of global impoverishment. DSK was complicit in this process of market manipulation. The removal of food and fuel subsidies in Tunisia and Egypt had been demanded by the IMF. Food and fuel prices skyrocketed, people were impoverished, paving the way towards the January 2011 social protest movement: Fiscal prudence remains an overarching priority for the [Tunisian] authorities, who also see the need for maintaining a supportive fiscal policy in 2010 in the current international environment. Efforts in the last decade to bring down the public debt ratio significantly should not be jeopardized by a too lax fiscal policy. The authorities are committed to firmly control current expenditure, including subsidies,... (IMF Tunisia: 2010 Article IV Consultation - Staff Report; Public Information Notice on the Executive Board Discussion; and Statement by the Executive Director for Tunisia) ""[The IMF] encouraged the [Egyptian] authorities to press further with food and fuel subsidy reforms, and welcomed their intention to improve the efficiency and targeting of food subsidy programs. [meaning the selective elimination of food subsidies]. ""Consideration should be given to introducing automatic adjustment mechanisms for domestic fuel prices to minimize distortions [meaning dramatic increases in fuel prices without State interference], while strengthening cash-based social programs to protect vulnerable groups. (IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with the Arab Republic of Egypt Public Information Notice , PIN No. 09/04, January 15, 2009) Under the helm of DSK, the IMF also imposed sweeping austerity measures on Egypt in 2008, while supporting Hosni Mubarak's ""efforts to broaden the privatization program"".(Ibid) The Frank G. Wisner Nicolas Sarkozy Connection Strauss-Kahn was refused bail by Judge Melissa Jackson, an appointee and protégé of Michael Bloomberg, who in addition to his role as Mayor is a powerful figure on Wall Street. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. charged (using scanty evidence) Strauss-Kahn ""with seven crimes, including attempted rape, sexual abuse, forcible touching and unlawful imprisonment"". Who is Cyrus Vance Jr.? He is the son of the late Cyrus Vance who served as Secretary of State in the Carter administration. But there is more than meets the eye. Nicolas Sarkozy's step father Frank G. Wisner II, a prominent CIA official who married his step mother Christine de Ganay in 1977 served as Deputy Executive Secretary of State under the helm of Cyrus Vance Senior, father of District Attorney Cyrus Vance Junior. Is it relevant? The Vance and Wisner families had close personal ties. In turn Nicolas Sarkozy had close family ties with his step father Frank Wisner (and his half brothers and sisters in the US and one member of the Wisner was involved in Sarkozy's election campaign). It is also worth noting that Frank G. Wisner II was the son of one of America's most notorious spies, the late Frank Gardiner Wisner (1909- 1965), the mastermind behind the CIA sponsored coup which toppled the government of Mohammed Mossadegh in Iran in 1953. Wisner Jr. is also trustee of the Rockefeller Brothers Trust. While these various personal ties do not prove that Strauss-Kahn was the object of a set-up, the matter of Sarkozy's ties to the CIA via his step father, not to mention the ties of Frank G. Wisner II to the Cyrus Vance family are certainly worth investigating. Frank G, Wisner also played a key role as Obama's special intelligence envoy to Egypt at the height of the January 2011 protest movement. Did the CIA play a role? Was Strauss-Kahn framed by people in his immediate political entourage including President Obama and Secretary of the Treasury Tim Geithner?

Innocent before proven guilty? The US media has already cast its verdict. Will the court procedures be manipulated? One would expect that Strauss-Kahn be granted a fair trial, namely the same treatment as that granted to thousands of arrests on alleged sexual aggression charges in New York City. How many similar or comparable alleged sexual aggressions occur on a monthly basis in New York City? What is the underlying pattern? How many of these are reported to the police? How many are the object of police follow-up once a complaint has been filed? What is the percent of complaints submitted to police which are the object of police arrest? How many of these arrests lead to a judicial procedure? What are the delays in court procedures? How many of these arrests lead to release without a judicial procedure? How many of the cases submitted to a judicial procedure are dismissed by the presiding judge? How many of the cases which are not dismissed are refused bail outright by the presiding judge? What is the basis for refusing bail? How many are granted bail? What is the average amount of bail? How many are imprisoned without bail based on scanty and incomplete evidence? How many of those who are refused bail are sent to an infamous maximum security prison on Rikers Island on the orders of Michael Bloomberg. Diplomatic Immunity Press reports state that full diplomatic immunity does not apply to officials of the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions, namely that the US did not ratify the protocol. ""U.N. convention on privileges and immunities for international agencies that most countries have ratified. It gives the heads of U.N. agencies broad immunity in the countries where they are based. But the U.S. government never became a party to that treaty. Employees of international agencies are covered by a U.S. statute that gives only limited immunity."" The relevant question is how has this limited immunity provision been applied in practice? Namely how many people with limited immunity (UN officials, officials of the Bretton Woods institutions) have been arrested and sent to a high security prison? Has Strauss Kahn been given the same treatment as those arrested under the provisions of ""limited immunity""? Does the Strauss Kahn arrest fit the pattern? Or is Strauss Kahn being treated in a way which does not correspond to the normal (average) pattern of police and judicial procedures applied in the numerous cases of persons arrested on alleged sexual assault charges? Without a frame-up instrumented by very powerful people acting in the background, the head of the IMF would have been treated in an entirely different way. The mayor of New York Michael Bloomberg and Timothy Geithner would have come to his rescue. The matter would have been hushed up with a view to protecting the reputation of a powerful public figure. But that did not happen.

The result as his detailed examples from all parts of the world show so convincingly, is a globalization of poverty. This book is a skilful combination of lucid explanation and cogently argued critique of the fundamental directions in which our world is moving financially and economically. In this new enlarged edition –which includes ten new chapters and a new introduction-- the author reviews the causes and consequences of famine in Sub-Saharan Africa, the dramatic meltdown of financial markets, the demise of State social programs and the devastation resulting from corporate downsizing and trade liberalisation. Michel Chossudovsky is Professor of Economics (emeritus) at the University of Ottawa and Director of the Centre for Research on Globalization (CRG), which hosts the critically acclaimed website www.globalresearch.ca . He is a contributor to the Encyclopedia Britannica. His writings have been translated into more than 20 languages. Published in 13 languages. More than 120,000 copies sold Worldwide. In these unprecedented economic times, the world is experiencing as a whole what most of the non-Industrialized world has experienced over the past several decades. Michel Chossudovsky takes the reader through a nuanced examination of the intricacies of the global political-economic landscape and the power players within it; specifically, looking at how the World Bank and IMF have been the greatest purveyors of poverty around the world, despite their rhetorical claims to the opposite. These institutions, representing the powerful Western nations and the financial interests that dominate them, spread social apartheid around the world, exploiting both the people and the resources of the vast majority of the world's population. As Chossudovsky examines in this updated edition, often the programs of these International Financial Instittutions go hand-in-hand with covert military and intelligence operations undertaken by powerful Western nations with an objective to destabilize, control, destroy and dominate nations and people, such as in the cases of Rwanda and Yugoslavia. To understand what role these international organizations play today, being pushed to the front lines and given unprecedented power and scope as ever before to manage the Global Economic Crisis, one must understand from whence they came. This book provides a detailed, exploratory, readable and multi-faceted examination of these institutions and actors as agents of the 'New World Order,' for which they advance the 'Globalization of Poverty.'

42	Strauss-Kahn under house arrest in New York	"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn remained under house arrest and armed guard on Saturday in an apartment in New York's financial district that has become a tourist attraction.
Strauss-Kahn, who was released from jail on Friday, was expected to stay in the apartment in Manhattan for a few days until permanent housing could be found, as he defends himself against charges of attempting to rape a maid in a New York hotel."	"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn remained under house arrest and armed guard on Saturday in an apartment in New York's financial district that has become a tourist attraction. Strauss-Kahn, who was released from jail on Friday, was expected to stay in the apartment in Manhattan for a few days until permanent housing could be found, as he defends himself against charges of attempting to rape a maid in a New York hotel. A trial may be six months or more away. The temporary housing was arranged by a private security company that is guarding Strauss-Kahn at an estimated cost of $200,000 a month, which he is responsible for paying. Satellite trucks lined the block outside the apartment, and scores of reporters and photographers waited for a glimpse of the man who until a week ago was one of the most powerful financial figures in the world. Once a strong contender to be the next president of France, Strauss-Kahn resigned as head of the International Monetary Fund on Wednesday. French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde was seen as the leading contender to succeed him. Strauss-Kahn was detained by police in New York a week ago, just hours after the alleged attack at the Sofitel hotel in Manhattan. He is due to reappear in court on June 6, when he will formally answer the charges. He denies the sexual assault accusations made by the maid, a 32-year-old widow from Guinea. If convicted, he could face 25 years in prison. Word of the new tenant at 71 Broadway quickly spread. Curious pedestrians questioned police officers stationed at the entrance and took pictures of the media. A guide on a tour bus heading down the street could be heard on a microphone pointing out the building as the one where Strauss-Kahn was staying. Some neighbours seemed less than thrilled, complaining about the added security and throngs of media. ""I don't like all of this,"" said Ian Horowitz, 29, a resident who works in finance. ""I don't like all the attention and all the people outside."" A deal to have Strauss-Kahn stay in an apartment on the city's Upper East Side fell through after the media besieged the building. CRISIS MANAGEMENT He is only allowed to leave his apartment to travel within Manhattan for court appearances, meetings with his lawyers, medical appointments and a weekly religious observance. His legal team has informally sought public relations advice from a Washington consulting firm, TD International, run by former CIA officers and U.S. diplomats. A source said if the firm signs on, its role will be helping in crisis management. In France, Le Monde reported Strauss-Kahn's lawyers have employed Guidepost Solutions, a global investigations firm headed by Bart Schwartz, former criminal division chief in the Manhattan District Attorney's office. Other company officers include the former global head of security for IBM and a former federal prosecutor and U.S. Secret Service special agent. Also in France, feminist organizations published a petition saying they were ""stunned by the daily flood of misogynist comments by public figures"" since Strauss-Kahn was detained. They said his friends and allies have downplayed the plight of the alleged victim -- former French culture minister Jack Lang said Strauss-Kahn should have been released earlier, considering ""nobody has died."" ""We are witnessing a sudden rise of sexist and reactionary reflexes, so quick to surface among part of the French elite,"" the groups said in a statement on the website of the newspaper. CAMPAIGN FOR IMF TOP JOB With the sudden vacancy in the IMF's top job, its board has said the process for finding a new chief would be completed by June 30. With the euro zone debt crisis still far from controlled, European and U.S. officials want to move quickly. The chair of the IMF's main advisory panel, the International Monetary and Financial Committee, Tharman Shanmugaratnam, who is also Singapore's finance minister, said it was imperative that the process be open and transparent. ""The challenges we face are pressing and an early conclusion to the selection process will be advantageous,"" he said in a statement on Saturday. Lagarde, backed by many European governments, has been praised for her role in tackling the European debt crisis and the handling of demands of advanced and developing economies through France's presidency of the Group of 20 this year. But developing countries, with growing clout in the world economy, were keeping pressure on Europe and the United States to avoid a backroom deal over the appointment. The IMF has been run by a European ever since it was created at the end of World War Two. Lagarde, who headed U.S. law firm Baker & McKenzie in Chicago before joining the French government in 2005, would be the first woman to head the IMF. Former Turkish economy minister Kemal Dervis had been seen as another frontrunner, but he ruled himself out on Friday, putting pressure on emerging nations to find a consensus candidate. (Additional reporting by Leslie Wroughton in Washington and Jessica Rinaldi in New York; Writing by Ellen Wulfhorst, Editing by Christopher Wilson and Paul Simao) Corrects May 21 story's second graph to say Strauss-Kahn will defend himself against charges of attempting to rape a maid, not charges of raping a maid."
43	Lawyer: No US call to IMF chief's French accuser	"A French writer who has alleged Dominique Strauss-Kahn sexually assaulted her nine years ago has not been contacted by U.S.
Her lawyer has said she was dissuaded from pressing charges at the time by her mother, an official in Strauss-Kahn's Socialist party.
The arrest of Strauss-Kahn, a suave Socialist politician who until last week was a leading contender for France's 2012 presidential election, has shocked and riveted France."	"A French writer who has alleged Dominique Strauss-Kahn sexually assaulted her nine years ago has not been contacted by U.S. prosecutors who have indicted the former IMF chief on sex charges in New York, her lawyer said Monday. David Koubbi said ""there has been no attempt to get in touch."" He said his client, Tristane Banon, does not intend to assist the American prosecution, and he doesn't believe she can be forced to cooperate. ""My client is French. I am a French lawyer,"" Koubbi told The Associated Press in an interview. ""We are in two very different judicial systems. My client won't be forced to do anything by American justice."" Strauss-Kahn is on bail and under house arrest in New York, awaiting trial for allegedly attempting to rape a hotel housekeeper. He denies all charges but has resigned as head of the International Monetary Fund. Banon has alleged that Strauss-Kahn wrenched open her bra and tried to unbutton her jeans in a rape attempt in 2002. Her lawyer has said she was dissuaded from pressing charges at the time by her mother, an official in Strauss-Kahn's Socialist party. Assistant U.S. District Attorney John A. McConnell said in court last week that New York authorities were investigating at least one other case of ""conduct similar to the conduct alleged"" against Strauss-Kahn. Koubbi said that had been widely interpreted to mean Banon's case. But he said she had no intention of pressing charges while the American prosecution was going on because the two cases should be kept separate. Koubbi said that Strauss-Kahn should be convicted or acquitted on the U.S. charges alone, and if ""American investigators need to pile up two cases to obtain a conviction ... we will absolutely refuse any kind of cooperation."" He said he did not rule out Banon pressing charges after the U.S case is over _ but a 10-year statute of limitations in France means that must be done by next year. The arrest of Strauss-Kahn, a suave Socialist politician who until last week was a leading contender for France's 2012 presidential election, has shocked and riveted France. Koubbi said Banon's life had been turned upside down by her connection with the politician. He said the 31-year-old novelist ""can't live in her home anymore because her residence is constantly surrounded by journalists and paparazzi. She can't answer her mobile phone anymore. Her voice mail is full. People she hasn't seen for eight years are trying to get in touch with her because getting an interview with her is priceless."" ""Here's how she feels: She became the heart of a story without having any say in the matter."" ___ Catherine Gaschka contributed to this report."
44	The IMF after Dominique Strauss-Kahn	"Non-Europeans suspected that the Europeans were getting favorable deals under a French politician-turned-economist who wanted to return to politics.
Indeed, even back in 1973, there was substantial support for a non-European candidate, Roberto Alemann, the distinguished economist and former Argentine economics minister.
Today, the world’s overwhelming strategic problem is to adjust to a new economic and political geography, in which the weight of the global economy is shifting eastwards and southwards."	"The IMF after Dominique Strauss-Kahn Harold James, Project Syndicate, Princeton | Sat, 05/21/2011 12:30 PM | Opinion A | A | A | How the mighty International Monetary Fund has fallen. More than a decade ago, the French magazine Paris Match carried a picture of the Fund’s then Managing Director, Michel Camdessus, with the title: “The Most Powerful Frenchman in the World.” Today, his successor, Dominique Strauss-Kahn (DSK), handcuffed and grave in ubiquitous front-page photos, is the most humiliated Frenchman in the world. One unanticipated result of the lurid New York sex scandal involving DSK is that the question of his successor is attracting an unprecedented level of public interest and concern. Indeed, the scandal has exposed some fundamental problems about the IMF’s governance, and even about its existence. DSK tried to remake the IMF into a doctor of global finance, rather than a policeman. In mitigating or even preventing financial crises, however, sometimes policemen are needed. At the moment, the combination of excesses still evident in the financial sector and in public finance in many countries calls for some fairly tough police action. Any organization is always much more than simply the person who happens to lead it, but a weak or politicized figure at its head can do great damage. Unfortunately, about half of the IMF’s past managing directors have been either weak or overly political — or both. The IMF’s first two managing directors, the Belgian Camille Gutt and the Swede Ivar Rooth, were both weak figures. Indeed, the Fund almost disappeared into complete oblivion during their tenure. The IMF’s two most recent managing directors before DSK, a German and a Spaniard, were also weak. Horst Köhler, appointed in 2000, got the millennium started on a bad note. He had been an influential state secretary in Germany’s finance ministry, before becoming the head of the associations of savings banks. Germany’s then chancellor, Gerhard Schröder, pressed hard for a German appointee to lead the Fund, but Köhler was always an implausible second-choice candidate. He resigned in 2004 to run as Angela Merkel’s candidate for the largely ceremonial office of President of the German Federal Republic, a job he performed capriciously until he abruptly resigned. Köhler’s successor, Rodrigo Rato, had been the leader of Spain’s center-right party, which was unexpectedly defeated in the 2004 general election by current Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero. He was sent to Washington as a consolation prize, and was never very happy there. The IMF’s influence dwindled, and he resigned in 2007 “for personal reasons.” DSK, too, began his tenure at the IMF as a politician-in-exile, after emerging as French President Nicolas Sarkozy’s most formidable domestic opponent. Sarkozy and his strategists, no doubt, thought that sending DSK to the Fund, which before the global financial crisis looked unimportant and marginal, was a brilliant coup. They may have even calculated that his private life might cause a stir in a country that is both more prudish and prurient than France. But when the IMF reemerged after 2008 as a central global institution, with DSK appearing to reorient it with substantial political and economic skill, he started to look again like a threat to Sarkozy’s re-election bid. The IMF’s heavy engagement in resolving Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis adds another element of political complexity. Non-Europeans suspected that the Europeans were getting favorable deals under a French politician-turned-economist who wanted to return to politics. And some Europeans worried that the Fund was taking sides in a polarized intra-European dispute about how the costs of the financial crisis should be shared. Recent appointments to head the IMF have all been pushed through after high-level bargaining among European governments. There is now a need to break decisively with the discredited political logic that drives such decisions. The convention that the IMF’s managing director needs to be a West European is not written down anywhere, least of all in the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. Indeed, even back in 1973, there was substantial support for a non-European candidate, Roberto Alemann, the distinguished economist and former Argentine economics minister. The IMF’s history is also a guide to the kind of figure who works most productively in Washington. None of the three most powerful and influential managing directors had been a politician or government minister. Per Jacobsson, the Swedish economist who brought the Fund back from obscurity in the 1950s, had been an official at the Bank for International Settlements in Basel. As the BIS’s chief economist in the 1930s, Jacobsson knew how to use economic analysis as a basis for influence. Jacques de Larosière and Michel Camdessus were French civil servants who combined high-level technical and managerial expertise with a vision of how the world economy should operate. Today, the world’s overwhelming strategic problem is to adjust to a new economic and political geography, in which the weight of the global economy is shifting eastwards and southwards. It is tempting to conclude that appointing a well-connected figure from an emerging-market economy could solve the problem. But such an outcome would be to repeat the thinking of the past, when the main need was to broker influence between Europe and the US. Appointing an Asian political icon would merely change the names of the players; it would not reinvent the game. The IMF needs a managing director who transcends political logic and can lay out the economics of the new global order. The next one should be Eastern rather than Western, an economist rather than a politician, and a visionary rather than a tactician. The writer is Professor of History and International Affairs at Princeton University and Professor of History at the European University Institute, Florence. His most recent book is The Creation and Destruction of Value: The Globalization Cycle."

46	Effects of IMF chief's 'perp walk' ripple outward	"We don't know whether Dominique Strauss-Kahn - who heads the International Monetary Fund and, until a few days ago, was likely to be the Socialist Party candidate for president of France - is guilty of the alleged sexual assault for which he was arrested."	"It's almost enough to give socialism a bad name. We don't know whether Dominique Strauss-Kahn - who heads the International Monetary Fund and, until a few days ago, was likely to be the Socialist Party candidate for president of France - is guilty of the alleged sexual assault for which he was arrested. Like anyone, he is presumed innocent until court proceedings prove otherwise. We do know, however, that at the time of the reported incident on Saturday, Strauss-Kahn was resident in a $3,000-a-night luxury suite at a posh Midtown Manhattan hotel. We also know that when he was taken into police custody hours later, aboard a Paris-bound jetliner that was moments from takeoff at John F. Kennedy International Airport, police found him comfortably ensconced in the first-class cabin. I didn't think this was how socialists were supposed to roll. The tinge of opulent decadence that colors the whole episode would seem, at first impression, to cast a dishonorable light upon powerful, unaccountable, jet-setting international bureaucrats in general, with perhaps a special spotlight of shame for the French-intellectual variety. But Strauss-Kahn, who is based at IMF headquarters in Washington, was apparently in New York on private business. Then again, had it been an IMF trip, Strauss-Kahn would have been covered by diplomatic immunity - and thus, perhaps, might have avoided the indignity of being held overnight in the Special Victims Unit lockup while detectives searched his person for potential DNA evidence. He almost certainly would have been spared the handcuffed ""perp walk"" as he was transferred to court for arraignment. Whatever happened took place at the Sofitel, one of the sleeker of New York's upper-echelon hotels. A 32-year-old female housekeeper - according to published reports, an African immigrant - entered Strauss-Kahn's suite to clean up, believing the guest had already departed. In her account, Strauss-Kahn emerged naked from the bathroom. She apologized and tried to leave, but Strauss-Kahn allegedly blocked her way, accosted her in the suite's bedroom, and then sexually assaulted her in the bathroom. The housekeeper reported the alleged attack to her supervisors, but by time police were called, Strauss-Kahn had checked out. He later called the hotel to say that he believed he had left his cellphone behind, however, and, according to published reports, a fast-thinking hotel employee told him - falsely - that the phone had been found and asked where it could be delivered. This is apparently how authorities learned he was at JFK, waiting to board an Air France flight to Paris. Strauss-Kahn's arrest had immediate and far-reaching impact. The most definitive seemed to be the extinction of his political career - and with it, perhaps, the best chance the Socialist Party might have had of defeating President Nicolas Sarkozy in next year's election. And the arrest came amid delicate, complicated and urgent negotiations to rescue the European Union's most threatened economies. Strauss-Kahn was a key figure in the ongoing talks, and while others can pick up where he leaves off, the financial markets could be unnerved by his absence. Even if the New York allegations turn out not to be true, the incident revived memories of an admittedly improper affair that Strauss-Kahn had with a subordinate. It's useful to be reminded that there was a time when powerful men could expect such incidents to be dismissed as misunderstandings or indiscretions, not prosecuted as criminal assaults. Yes, this sounds like the age of the dinosaurs. Dominique Strauss-Kahn gives every evidence of being one. Email Eugene Robinson at eugenerobinson@washpost.com"
47	Sight of ex-IMF head's wife rewards eager NY crowd	"Anne Sinclair, a prominent French TV journalist before her marriage to Strauss-Kahn, left the couple's temporary apartment in lower Manhattan late Sunday morning and stepped into a waiting SUV.

He is accused of attacking a 32-year-old housekeeper on May 14 in his $3,000-a-night hotel suite in midtown Manhattan."	"Anne Sinclair, a prominent French TV journalist before her marriage to Strauss-Kahn, left the couple's temporary apartment in lower Manhattan late Sunday morning and stepped into a waiting SUV. She returned four hours later, her activities a mystery. The 62-year-old Strauss-Kahn, once a French presidential contender, remains ensconced in the granite skyscraper as cameras and armed guards keep watch. Outside, open-top buses slow down as tourists snap photos of Strauss-Kahn's temporary home. Since Strauss-Kahn was moved there Friday from his Rikers Island jail cell, a crowd of international reporters has been gathered around the clock. The cost to secure him has been estimated at $200,000 a month. The funds, which he must cover, will go toward armed surveillance, the installation of cameras and a special bracelet shackled to his ankle that will set off an alarm if he travels too far. Right now, he's not allowed out of the building at all, but after he's moved to a more permanent location, he can leave for court, doctor visits and weekly religious services. Prosecutors must be notified at least six hours before he goes anywhere. He can't be out between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. It's not clear when Strauss-Kahn will be moved, though prosecutors have said the security company advised that Broadway apartment would be available for only three or four days. He is accused of attacking a 32-year-old housekeeper on May 14 in his $3,000-a-night hotel suite in midtown Manhattan. The West African immigrant told police he chased her down a hallway in the suite, forced her to perform oral sex and tried to remove her stockings. He is scheduled for arraignment on June 6. Another Manhattan building rejected him after residents expressed fears about the kind of 24-hour media frenzy being staged on Broadway behind police barricades. Sinclair, who is wealthy in her own right, has stood by her husband since his arrest, helping secure the $5 million bond the judge added to the bail agreement. Strauss-Kahn resigned Wednesday as managing director of the International Monetary Fund, an organization that provides billions in loans to stabilize the world economy. France's finance minister, Christine Lagarde, has emerged as a front-runner to replace Strauss-Kahn, but emerging economies have pressed for an end to Europe's traditional stranglehold on the position of IMF managing director. The IMF has been accepting nominations from member countries for candidates to succeed Strauss-Kahn. Its executive board said it plans to make its selection by the end of June."

"Dominique Strauss-Kahn's fall from grace has been nearly as quick as it's been painful. On Saturday, the head of the International Monetary Fund, previously considered a leading 2012 candidate for president of France, was arrested in New York City on charges of sexual assaulting a hotel housekeeper. By Wednesday, Strauss-Kahn, who has been denied bail, found himself in prison and on suicide watch , his reputation in shambles. With the global economy still recovering from recession and dealing with debt crises, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner emphasized on Tuesday the importance of the IMF quickly and ""formally"" appointing an interim leader, according to Bloomberg . ""There's a lot going on in the world,"" Geithner said. ""[Y]ou want the IMF to have the capacity to be helpful in that context,"" and Strauss-Kahn currently is ""obviously not in a position"" to do that, he continued, according to Bloomberg. Even before Geithner's comments, some European leaders, including Austrian finance minister Maria Fekter, called for Strauss-Kahn's resignation. ""Considering the situation, that bail was denied, he has to figure out for himself, that he is hurting the institution,"" Fekter said to journalists, according to the Guardian . Elena Salgado, Spain's finance minister, agrees that Strauss-Kahn must decide for himself whether to step down over the ""extraordinarily serious"" charges, according to the Financial Times .

One employee who claimed have a brief affair with Strauss-Kahn had warned of his behavior in writing three years ago, saying Strauss-Kahn might not be fit to hold such a powerful position. An official within the French Socialist Party has also come forward to say her daughter was attacked by Strauss-Kahn in 2002. In France, 57 percent of those polled say they believe Strauss-Kahn has been the subject of a plot. Among French Socialists, that number rises to 70 percent, according to the Guardian . Most immediately, Strauss-Kahn's resignation has thrown the state of the Greek debt crisis into doubt. Strauss-Kahn had been been particularly flexible with Greece during bailout talks, according to multiple reports. On Wednesday, an IMF envoy said that unless the debt-ridden country can sharply accelerate necessary reforms, Greece's debt program ""will run off track."""

50	Bad Timing: The Washingtonian and DSK	"Yes, please No thanks Submit › Make a new comment on this article Advertisements | Add your own See More on Patch - An Intern's Farewell to Georgetown - Special Election Sends Signal - Tweet it Like You Mean It: Apr. 10 to Apr. 16 - Mayor Gray Cleans House - Tweet it Like You Mean It: Feb."	"The June issue of Washingtonian prominently features a lengthy feature by a well-known French journalist on Georgetown’s ‘invisible man’ who hobnobs with world leaders including President Obama and who might, just might, became “the next president of France.” You guessed it. It’s the now-notorious DSK…Dominique Strauss- Kahn, the former head of the International Monetary Fund, who at the precise time Washingtonian magazine was rolling off the presses happened to be cooling his heels at Rikers Island on ‘suicide watch’ after rape allegations against him at a $3,000 a night hotel suite in midtown Manhattan. Oh how quickly the high and mighty can fall. And how fast what once appeared to be a promising and insightful feature story can turn into yesterday’s news to be taken out with the garbage. The gushing piece, written by Apolline de Malherbe who now lives in Georgetown, is easy to ridicule in retrospect. But really who knew the real DSK? Certainly not his Georgetown neighbors, international jet-setters nor the fawning ‘journalists’ covering the IMF. But there were many porevious hints. And the harassing environment for women who work at the IMF has been the topic of insider gossip in the nation’s capital for at least the past 20 years, maybe longer. The Washingtonian article even does a side-by-side comparison on DSK’s glamorous dual lives here in Georgetown and in Paris. “A Tale of Two Cities: In Paris: He’s known as the leading candidate to unseat President Nicolas Sarkozy. In Washington: He’s known as a powerful relatively anonymous bureaucrat.”  (Well, not anymore.) In Paris: His wife is known as the most famous TV journalist of the last 30 years. In Washington: His wife is a housewife who blogs. His home (in Paris) : an apartment in the trendy Marais neighborhood. His home (in DC) a $4-million house next to Rock Creek Park in Georgetown. In Paris: His romantic exploits: quietly whispered about. In Washington: His romantic exploits: covered on the front page of the Wall Street Journal.” Well, you get the drift.                   To add insult to injury, the largest headline on the story misspells DSK’s last name calling him Strauss-Khan instead of Strauss-Kahn. Fortunately, perhaps, this journalistic gem has just been posted online, according to Washingtonian editor Garrett M. Graff, just back from a trip to Europe.  You can find it at this link according to Graff: http://www.washingtonian.com/articles/people/19460.html That’s a tad unusual because the magazine routinely serves up stories to its premier list of home subscribers weeks ahead of posting those same stories on its website.  In any event, the new June issue of the magazine is available at most local newsstands as well. For a mere $3.95 it could be a collector’s item someday. Who knows? The magazine’s website also contains some interesting tweets about the adventures of DSK. As Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson put it the other day : “I didn’t think this is how socialists were supposed to roll.” What do you think about the allegations raised again the former IMF chief and the recent focus on the climate at the institution for women?

51	Bill Jamieson: A Greek tragedy reaching final act	"Disagreement between the European Central Bank and member governments has never been deeper or more forcefully expressed.
And all the while a deadline ticks away towards a summit in weeks on a vital ¤500 billion (£438 billioADVERTISEMENT n) European Stability Mechanism with agreement nowhere in sight.
Indeed, the German government and many eurozone senior diplomats believe it offers the best means, perhaps not of ""solving"" the Greek crisis but of buying precious time."	"But here is where we are. Disagreement between the European Central Bank and member governments has never been deeper or more forcefully expressed. And all the while a deadline ticks away towards a summit in weeks on a vital ¤500 billion (£438 billioADVERTISEMENT n) European Stability Mechanism with agreement nowhere in sight. The stakes could scarcely be higher. According to ECB executive board member Jurgen Stark last week, a Greek default might put the impact of the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 ""in the shade"". Were other stricken eurozone members such as Ireland and Portugal to renege on their debt, the fear within the ECB is that its losses would very quickly multiply. Member governments would then be forced to recapitalise the central bank at colossal cost. Could financial Europe withstand a crisis on the scale of Lehman? Seen from this perspective, it is not a Christine Lagarde or Gordon Brown or Trevor Manuel that the IMF needs for a successor to Dominique Strauss-Kahn but the shuttle diplomacy of a Henry Kissinger and the power of Carl von Clausewitz. Of the millions of words expended on the eurozone's rolling crisis thus far, it has taken just one anodyne term to blow open profound divisions between Eurozone diplomats and the central bank. At the centre of the storm is a proposal for the ""re-profiling"" of Greek debt. It seems innocuous enough. Indeed, the German government and many eurozone senior diplomats believe it offers the best means, perhaps not of ""solving"" the Greek crisis but of buying precious time. Greece has been struggling for months to carry out reforms agreed under its ¤110bn EU/IMF bail-out. This has prompted fears that it will not be able to pay its debts, currently totalling some ¤340bn (£298bn). In an attempt to defuse the crisis, European Union officials floated the idea of a debt ""re-profiling"" - a polite way of describing a re-writing of the debt terms. This could take the form of pushing back the repayment timetable or deferring interest payments to the later years of the loan."
52	"Politics and policy IMF chief resigns, vows to prove innocence"	"Dominique Strauss-Kahn resigned Thursday as head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), saying he did so with great regret but must focus entirely on clearing his name of sexual assault charges.
Strauss-Kahn, a leading French politician, is currently in jail awaiting a grand jury decision on whether to indict him on charges of the alleged sexual assault and attempted rape of a 32-year-old Manhattan hotel chambermaid."	"Dominique Strauss-Kahn resigned Thursday as head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), saying he did so with great regret but must focus entirely on clearing his name of sexual assault charges. The move came after escalating pressure on the IMF to chart a course through the leadership crisis and promised to kick off a succession battle between emerging economies and Western nations that have long dominated the world body. ""I want to protect this institution which I have served with honour and devotion, and especially -- especially -- I want to devote all my strength, all my time, and all my energy to proving my innocence,"" Strauss-Kahn said. Related Stories - IMF chief charged with sex attack in US hotel - The rape charge that has thrown IMF into disarray - Straus-Kahn’s rape charge stuns France ahead of election ""I deny with the greatest possible firmness all of the allegations that have been made against me."" His short statement paid tribute to his American-born wife, journalist Anne Sinclair, who he said he loved more than anything, and spoke of his ""infinite sadness"" at being compelled to leave a job to which he had also been devoted. Strauss-Kahn, a leading French politician, is currently in jail awaiting a grand jury decision on whether to indict him on charges of the alleged sexual assault and attempted rape of a 32-year-old Manhattan hotel chambermaid. His lawyers were expected to tout his wife's American credentials before a judge later Thursday in a fresh bid to free him from the tough Rikers Island jail, where he spent his third night in isolation and on suicide watch. The new bail application argues that he should not be considered a flight risk because he has strong US ties through property and family. The application mentions a $4 million home in Washington, DC, a daughter in New York, and says Sinclair is ""currently working on a book about American political life."" In addition to the $1 million Strauss-Kahn's lawyers said he can post for bail, they said he is willing to be confined to a Manhattan apartment 24 hours a day, with electronic monitoring, until the case is resolved. ""These additional bail conditions eliminate any concern that Mr Strauss-Kahn would or could leave this court's jurisdiction,"" attorney Shawn Naunton wrote. The chambermaid, who has accused one of the world's most powerful men of trying to rape her on Saturday in his luxury hotel suite, earlier went before the grand jury that must decide if there is enough evidence to go to trial. The single mother of a 15-year-old daughter alleges that Strauss-Kahn groped and mauled her in his room in the posh Sofitel hotel in Times Square and forcibly tried to have oral sex with her. Her lawyer, Jeff Shapiro, refused to comment on the closed-door grand jury proceedings but hit back at claims his client was part of an elaborate set-up intended to bring down the man once seen as a leading presidential hopeful. Shapiro has shot down the idea that his client, an immigrant from Guinea in West Africa, had consented to a sexual encounter and suggested forensic evidence would back her up."
53	Gang-of-four had skilfully paved presidential path	"All four - Stphane Fouks, Gilles Finchelstein, Ramzi Khiroun and Anne Hommel - are employed by Euro RSCG, the fifth-largest communications company in the world.
The influence of the ""gang of four"" has long been a source of irritation among some of Strauss-Kahn's socialist party colleagues, who believe they exacerbate his vulnerabilities: a flashy lifestyle, neglect of the parliamentary party, distance from the working class."	"RUADHN Mac CORMAIC A tight communications campaign has been derailed by the charges facing the ex-IMF chief THEY WERE considered one of the most formidable public relations teams in France, the authors of a strategy that had brought Dominique Strauss-Kahn to the cusp of securing his party's nomination for the presidency. Known to the media as ""the gang of four"" and to some in the Socialist Party as ""the firm"", they formed a praetorian guard around DSK, skilfully preparing the ground for his presidential campaign with carefully placed leaks and interviews that kept his poll numbers rising and his name firmly in the public mind. All four - Stphane Fouks, Gilles Finchelstein, Ramzi Khiroun and Anne Hommel - are employed by Euro RSCG, the fifth-largest communications company in the world. The most senior is Fouks, a close confidant with huge influence in Paris (14 of the CAC40 companies have contracts with him), who advised the former International Monetary Fund (IMF) managing director on the euro-zone crisis and domestic politics. Fouks recruited the other three to Euro RSCG: Finchelstein's role was that of scriptwriter and number-cruncher, analysing poll results and plotting electoral scenarios, while Khiroun and Hommel looked after relationships with journalists and Parisian powerbrokers. Khiroun is also an adviser to Arnaud Lagardre, who owns Paris Match, Elle, Le Journal du Dimancheand the radio station Europe 1. The influence of the ""gang of four"" has long been a source of irritation among some of Strauss-Kahn's socialist party colleagues, who believe they exacerbate his vulnerabilities: a flashy lifestyle, neglect of the parliamentary party, distance from the working class. When DSK was lampooned earlier this month over a photograph showing him stepping out of a EUR120,000 Porsche, socialist figures pointed out that the car belonged to Khiroun. ""If Dominique stands, he will be the socialist candidate - not the Euro RSCG candidate,"" party leader Martine Aubry said recently. But by far the most important of Strauss-Kahn advisers is his wife, Anne Sinclair. Since they married in 1991, when DSK was a relatively little-known chair of a parliamentary committee, Sinclair has shown him unwavering support. From a wealthy Parisian family, Sinclair was the respected anchor of a politics programme on TF1 television until her husband became finance minister and she stepped down. The couple are famously close. During the controversy over her husband's affair with a subordinate at the IMF in 2008, Sinclair wrote ""We love each other as much as we did on day one."" When news of Strauss-Kahn's arrest broke, Sinclair issued a statement in Paris saying she didn't believe ""for one second the accusations made against my husband"". Sinclair has flown to New York and yesterday attended her husband's bail hearing. The ""gang of four"" have not been taking telephone calls this week. - Email - Facebook - Twitter - LinkedIn - Reddit - | - More"
54	This Week: Two Views on the Obama Race Debate. PLUS: The 2012 GOP Field | The Nation	"In the wake of the Dominique Strauss-Kahn rape case, Executive Editor Betsy Reed offers an important reminder in ""What If DSK's Accuser Had Been Undocumented "": despite the laudable actions of Dominique Strauss Kahn’s accuser--a Guinean immigrant and single mother, the fact that she came forward with rape allegations is anomalous."	"Described by Andrew Sullivan as the “definitive takedown ,” Melissa Harris-Perry fires back in “Cornell West vs. Barack Obama ,” pointing out that West’s “thin criticisms” are disingenuous and vague. She pointed out in an appearance on MSNBC’s The Ed Show that the president has, in fact, spoken up for America’s underrepresented in his Supreme Court nominations and signing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. But, as Columnist Gary Younge points out in ""The Paradox of Hope ,"" African-Americans have actually fared worse under Obama: the economic gap between black and white has grown under his presidency. In the ensuing debate in the African-American community and elsewhere about whether Obama should do more, Younge says by concentrating so heavily on race, both sides detract from his responsibilities. Obama should do more for African-Americans: not because they're black but because they're suffering most. And they have every right to demand more of him: they gave him a greater percentage of their vote than any other group. THE DSK AFFAIR. In the wake of the Dominique Strauss-Kahn rape case, Executive Editor Betsy Reed offers an important reminder in ""What If DSK's Accuser Had Been Undocumented "": despite the laudable actions of Dominique Strauss Kahn’s accuser--a Guinean immigrant and single mother, the fact that she came forward with rape allegations is anomalous. Citing a study by the Southern Povery Law Center, Reed points out that a majority of women immigrants in the United States experience some form of sexual harassment or coercion on the job, and very few of them come forward. Columnist Katha Pollitt, in “DSK Déjà Vu ,” is right to suggest that in a culture deeply hostile to women—reflected in the response from the French political class and others who see the treatment of Strauss-Kahn as “unfair,” feminism’s job is not over.

55	"Former IMF chief's DNA matches sample on maid's clothes, sources say"	"Investigators said they believed the carpet in the hotel room may contain Strauss-Kahn's semen.
NYPD spokesman Paul J. Browne and the Manhattan district attorney's office would not comment.
Staff at the Sofitel told authorities that the 62-year-old had made passes at them the day before the alleged attack, including flirting with a clerk and calling another employee to ask her up to his room, according to a third person with direct knowledge of investigators' interviews with staff."	"The two people said additional testing was being performed on other items. They were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity. During their investigation, authorities cut out a piece of carpet and swabbed sinks and other surfaces in his hotel room. Investigators said they believed the carpet in the hotel room may contain Strauss-Kahn's semen. Strauss-Kahn's attorney Benjamin Brafman declined to comment on Monday. At a court hearing last week, he told a judge that forensic evidence developed in the investigation ""will not be consistent with a forcible encounter"" -- leading to speculation that Strauss-Kahn's defense would argue that it was consensual. NYPD spokesman Paul J. Browne and the Manhattan district attorney's office would not comment. The one-time French presidential contender has been charged with a criminal sex act, attempted rape and sexual abuse and is free on $1 million bail, under house arrest at a lower Manhattan apartment. He has been accused of attacking the 32-year-old West African immigrant on May 14 in his luxury suite at the Sofitel hotel near Manhattan's Times Square . His lawyers say he is innocent. Staff at the Sofitel told authorities that the 62-year-old had made passes at them the day before the alleged attack, including flirting with a clerk and calling another employee to ask her up to his room, according to a third person with direct knowledge of investigators' interviews with staff. Strauss-Kahn had flirted with one female staff member who accompanied him to his suite to make sure his accommodations were satisfactory after he checked in on May 13, the person said. Later, he phoned the desk clerk who had checked him in, asking her if she would like to get together with him when she got off duty, the person said. The desk clerk refused, saying she was not allowed to socialize with the VIP guest, the person said. That person also wasn't authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. On Monday, lawyers for Strauss-Kahn continued to search for new accommodations for their client as he awaits trial. His bail agreement hit a snag late last week after tenants at the Upper East Side apartment building chosen for his house arrest refused to allow him, citing unwanted media attention. Strauss-Kahn is currently housed at a temporary location under watch by armed guards with Stroz Friedberg, the same company that guarded disgraced financier Bernard Madoff . It was not clear when he would be moved. French and U.S. media have been staking out the building where Strauss-Kahn spent the weekend after he was released from his Rikers Island jail cell. He resigned last Wednesday from the IMF. His attorneys have described Strauss-Kahn as a loving father and family man. They say his actions after the alleged attack are not those of a guilty man eager for a quick escape. He left the hotel, had lunch and then phoned later to ask if he'd left anything behind. When he was told by hotel staff they had his cellphone, he told them exactly where he was: at John F. Kennedy International Airport on a flight bound for Paris. Authorities pulled him from the jetliner."
56	IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn quits over sex charge	"New York, May 19(ANI): Dominique Strauss-Kahn has resigned as head of the International Monetary Fund over allegations that he had sexually attacked a hotel maid in New York.
“It is with infinite sadness that I feel compelled today to present to the Executive Board my resignation from my post of Managing Director of the IMF,” The New York Times quoted Strauss-Kahn, as saying in a statement.
His resignation comes just days after he was taken off an Air France plane at New York’s Kennedy International Airport and arrested in connection with the alleged attack."	"New York, May 19(ANI): Dominique Strauss-Kahn has resigned as head of the International Monetary Fund over allegations that he had sexually attacked a hotel maid in New York. “It is with infinite sadness that I feel compelled today to present to the Executive Board my resignation from my post of Managing Director of the IMF,” The New York Times quoted Strauss-Kahn, as saying in a statement. “I think at this time first of my wife-whom I love more than anything-of my children, of my family, of my friends,” he added. His resignation comes just days after he was taken off an Air France plane at New York’s Kennedy International Airport and arrested in connection with the alleged attack. He again firmly denied the criminal charges against him. Strauss-Kahn, who is an economist and lawyer, has been charged with a criminal sex act and attempted rape over the alleged sexual assault. He faces a possible 25-year jail sentence. He remains in jail at New York’s Rikers Island as a grand jury considers whether there is sufficient evidence to indict him. His next court appearance is scheduled for Friday. The 62-year-old has risen to prominence while captaining the IMF through one of the world’s worst financial crises, and has led the IMF since 2007. He is also widely believed to challenge French president Nicolas Sarkozy in next year’s presidential election, and polls show he would have a good chance of removing the sitting president out of his office.

57	Beware Greeks Bearing Banks	") Greece is the poster child for this dilemma, and the Greek story reveals the real villain of the piece -- the big banks.
A group of European finance ministers raised the possibility of a ""soft"" restructuring of the Greek debt, so as not to reward speculators who were betting on a Greek default, but officials of the European Central Bank threw a fit, warning that the ECB would pull the plug on funding for Greek banks if such a restructuring were discussed."	"After every financial debacle or war, there is a huge political struggle over whether creditors and financial speculators get to stand in the way of an economic recovery. When the creditors win, ordinary people who had nothing to do with the crisis are typically the victims. Today, the entire political elite is in the austerity camp, and those who argue that creditors should take some losses so that the rest of the economy can grow are mostly ignored. This is the common theme to the issue of mortgage relief to spare American homeowners millions of foreclosures, the question of whether the US should sacrifice Medicare and Social Security on the altar of deficit reduction, and the punishment being visited upon small European economies such as Greece, Portugal and Ireland. (Though Dominique Strauss-Kahn was evidently a sexual predator, he was not a financial rapist when it came to vulnerable nations. He was a rare member of the ruling financial club who gave some attention to economic recovery over austerity.) Greece is the poster child for this dilemma, and the Greek story reveals the real villain of the piece -- the big banks. In February 2010, it was revealed that Goldman Sachs had been complicit in allowing previous Greek governments to cook their books and hide the size of the Greek deficit by creating a special kind of currency swap that was really a disguised loan. In the aftermath of the financial crisis, Greece's national debt is unsustainable, and only credits from the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund are keeping Greece from defaulting. The bankers want Greece to languish in debtor's prison, cutting wages and social benefits, increasing taxes, and otherwise sandbagging its own economy in order to pay back creditors at 100 cents on the Euro. Greece, however, is now in a vicious circle: the more the Greeks practice the austerity demanded by the money markets and the European Central Bank, the more the Greek economy predictably slumps and the more that money markets lose confidence that Greece will ever recover enough to pay back its bondholders. In this crisis, bankers are culpable in three different and reinforcing respects. First, we have the case of Goldman's complicity in helping the Greek previous government to get Greece in over its head. Secondly, the European Central Bank and the big German banks are opposed to a restructuring of the Greek debt -- trading short term bonds for longer term securities with reduced interest and principal -- because big banks are the major bondholders and resist taking any losses. Recently, a third concern came to light -- our old nemesis, credit default swaps (CDS). These are the very same toxic securities that were so implicated in the 2007-2009 financial crash. CDS are a form of insurance against default of securities. But unlike, say, underwriters of life insurance or fire insurance, the issuers of swaps seldom have adequate reserves against losses because they assume that defaults will hardly ever occur. Rather, CDS have become a favorite vehicle for speculation by hedge funds and investment banks. According a Friday Wall Street Journal report from Brussels, even a partial a restructuring of the Greek government debt could trigger payouts of credit default swaps. A group of European finance ministers raised the possibility of a ""soft"" restructuring of the Greek debt, so as not to reward speculators who were betting on a Greek default, but officials of the European Central Bank threw a fit, warning that the ECB would pull the plug on funding for Greek banks if such a restructuring were discussed. From the view of the ECB, the sheer complexity of financial markets is now such that any form of restructuring that would benefit Greece could set off ripples that might destabilize the system, so the ECB is dead set against it. Better for the Greeks just to suffer. It's clear that Greece can't pay its debts. The practical question is whether an adjustment will be accompanied by more pain or less, and whether the financial sector will be permitted to keep bleeding Greece dry. There is an instructive historical parallel. When American banks found themselves in big trouble in the 1980s because several third world countries could not pay back their loans, Nicholas Brady, Bush I's Treasury Secretary, came up with an ingenious plan. The debts would be stretched out, and the creditors would take a hit averaging about 30 percent. The banks were compelled to take their feet off the oxygen hoses of more than a dozen nations, and recovery of their real economies ensued. Worry about triggering payouts of credit default swaps was not an obstacle because, mercifully, credit default swaps had not been invented yet. The more we learn about these toxic securities and their abuse, the more wisdom we see in Paul Volcker's comment that the last useful innovation created by the financial industry was the ATM machine. The stakes are somehow clearer after wars than after financial busts. Bonds issued by defeated countries are worthless, so debts do not sandbag recoveries. Victorious countries typically restructure their own war debt, so that it doesn't cripple the postwar economy. (America's first treasury secretary, Alexander Hamilton, was a hero for devising a plan for the new federal government to assume the war debts.) We also remember the fatal lesson of the First World War, where the British and French tried to squeeze defeated Germany dry to pay off their own war debts -- and destroyed Germany's economy, thus creating grievances that led to World War II. After the second war, we didn't make the same mistake twice. But somehow, it's harder to win general support for debt relief after a financial collapse because details are more murky and the banks are so bloody powerful. The fact is that throughout modern history, governments have defaulted on debts dozens of times. It's more important for real economies to realize their productive potential than for bankers to get their pound of flesh. The choice doesn't have to be default or debtor's prison. A middle ground is debt restructuring of the sort being proposed for Greece, but the banks and their toadies in government are too greedy and short sighted to appreciate it. In the context of today's debt politics, Nick Brady, who faithfully served George H.W. Bush, is a dangerous radical. Robert Kuttner is co-editor of The American Prospect and a senior fellow at Demos.

58	French Finance Minister Lagarde Favored to Head IMF	"(Bloomberg News) French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde emerged as the leading contender to replace Dominique Strauss-Kahn at the International Monetary Fund as developing nations failed to unite behind a candidate.
“I would argue that Christine Lagarde has outstanding credentials,” Swedish Finance Minister Anders Borg said in a Bloomberg Television interview yesterday.
Trailing her were former Turkish Economy Minister Kemal Dervis and South Africa’s ex-Finance Minister Trevor Manuel, at 3-1 and 5-1 odds, respectively."	"(Bloomberg News) French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde emerged as the leading contender to replace Dominique Strauss-Kahn at the International Monetary Fund as developing nations failed to unite behind a candidate. U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner called for the quick appointment of a new managing director yesterday while the Obama administration avoided backing any one person. “We want to see an open process that leads to a prompt succession,” Geithner said in a statement. John Lipsky, the Washington-based IMF’s acting managing director, “will provide able and experienced leadership to the fund at this critical time for the global economy,” Geithner said. European officials moved to maintain control over the institution that approved a record $91.7 billion in emergency loans last year and provides a third of the euro-area’s bailout packages. Italy and Sweden backed Lagarde, while German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said he holds her in high esteem, the first public hint of German support. “I would argue that Christine Lagarde has outstanding credentials,” Swedish Finance Minister Anders Borg said in a Bloomberg Television interview yesterday. Her gender is an “advantage” since “half of the world has not been represented as managing director” of the IMF, Borg said. ‘Excellent Choice’ Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said Lagarde would be “an excellent choice” as Europe’s candidate, the Italian government said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. Berlusconi said it’s “fundamental” that Europe should reach a common position on whom the candidate should be as soon as possible, the statement said. Lagarde is now the “odds-on” favorite for the IMF’s top job after being a “20-1 outsider when betting began,” London- based bookmaker William Hill Plc said in an e-mailed statement today. Trailing her were former Turkish Economy Minister Kemal Dervis and South Africa’s ex-Finance Minister Trevor Manuel, at 3-1 and 5-1 odds, respectively. Officials in emerging markets including Thailand, Russia and South Africa said the next IMF managing director should come from a developing nation even as they failed to unite behind one candidate the way Europe coalesced around Lagarde. While Chinese officials haven’t publicly endorsed any candidate, Thailand and the Philippines backed Singapore Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam as a possible choice to succeed Strauss-Kahn at the IMF. Asia’s Push Philippine Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima said in an interview today that Shanmugaratnam “is certainly well qualified,” and his Thai counterpart Korn Chatikavanij said yesterday Asia has good candidates, including Shanmugaratnam. “I think the U.S. and Europe should take it upon themselves to really open this up to all candidates that are qualified, not necessarily just Europeans,” Purisima said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. The time has come for a non-European to head the IMF, according to Angel Gurria, secretary general of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. “The moment has come to change what is a tradition, which is that the IMF is led by a European,” the former Mexican finance minister told reporters in Paris today. Brazilian ex-central banker Arminio Fraga, South Africa’s Manuel, India’s Montek Singh Ahluwalia and Shanmugaratnam would all make “fine candidates” to lead the IMF, Raghuram Rajan, a professor at the University of Chicago and a former chief IMF economist, wrote in the Financial Times. China’s government has asked Peter Mandelson, a former U.K. business secretary and European trade commissioner, whether he’s interested in the job, the Guardian reported, citing no one. Resignation Strauss-Kahn resigned as the 10th leader of the IMF four days after his arrest in New York on sexual-assault charges. “I want to devote all my strength, all my time and all my energy to proving my innocence,” Strauss-Kahn said in a statement released by the IMF. The fund said it will comment “in the near future” on the succession. Strauss-Kahn, 62, had been leading in polls for France’s 2012 presidential election. Strauss-Kahn, a former French finance minister, was arrested May 14 on accusations of sexually assaulting a hotel maid and has been at New York’s Rikers Island jail complex since May 16. He may be released from jail as early as today after he was granted bail. While he has denied the accusations, he hasn’t entered a formal plea to any of the charges, which include attempted rape. The indictment in the case was filed yesterday. Greek Crisis European Union President Herman Van Rompuy urged a quick decision on a new IMF leader, saying Strauss-Kahn’s arrest has hurt efforts to tackle Greece’s financial crisis. “We can’t lose time,” Van Rompuy told a conference yesterday in Brussels. “We are feeling a lack of leadership in solving the Greek crisis.” Europeans have picked IMF heads for 65 years under a deal that also gives the U.S. control over the top World Bank post. The No. 2 person at the IMF has traditionally been chosen by the U.S. Lipsky, 64, the No. 2 official at the fund, will remain acting leader, the fund said in a statement May 18. Lipsky, a former chief economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co., is scheduled to retire in August. He called Lagarde “very, very talented” and a “capable leader.” Five-Year Tenure Strauss-Kahn’s five-year term had 17 months remaining. In past successions, managing directors were appointed to fresh five-year tenures. Strauss-Kahn earned an annual salary of $441,980 after taxes as of July 2009, plus an expense allowance of $79,120, also tax-free. The allowance would enable him to maintain “a scale of living appropriate to your position as managing director,” according to his contract. In addition, he could be reimbursed for “reasonable” entertainment expenses as well as first-class travel. Under the IMF’s rules, its executive board selects the managing director and any member can make a nomination. Prior to appointing Strauss-Kahn in 2007, the board said candidates must have a “distinguished record in economic policy-making at senior levels” and “demonstrated the managerial and diplomatic skills needed to lead a global institution.” The 2007 nomination period ran from early July to the end of August. The board then met with each candidate and sought to make its choice through consensus rather than majority vote. The appointment was made three months to the date after the resignation of Rodrigo de Rato. ‘European Candidate’ Lagarde “is an internationally recognized personality and is highly regarded also in Germany,” Germany’s Westerwelle said in an interview during a trip to Switzerland yesterday. “We Europeans have an interest in maintaining the European influence at the IMF.” German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters that Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis “speaks for a European candidate” to head the IMF and that a decision must be made swiftly. Her chief spokesman Steffen Seibert said he couldn’t confirm a Handelsblatt report that the government is preparing to throw its support behind Lagarde. Lagarde, 55, declined to comment on her potential candidacy when questioned by reporters in Paris yesterday. She said that the successor to Strauss-Kahn should come from Europe. ‘Lightning-Quick Wit’ Writing in Time magazine in 2009, Geithner said Lagarde had shown “what it takes to break down barriers” by becoming the first female Group of Seven finance minister and that he admired her “lightning-quick wit, genuine warmth and ability to bridge divides while remaining fiercely loyal to French interests.” “Rarely do the names Descartes and Voltaire emerge during a debate on global economic policy. But when they do, it often means Christine Lagarde is using philosophy to drive home a sophisticated point about the markets,” Geithner wrote. Lagarde’s chances may hinge on how she resolved a two- decade-old dispute involving a supporter of President Nicolas Sarkozy. The Cour de Justice de la Republique, which oversees ministers’ actions in office, has until June 10 to decide whether to investigate if Lagarde abused her powers in agreeing in 2007 to send the case to arbitration. It resulted in a 385 million-euro ($551 million) award to Bernard Tapie, a former Socialist minister who endorsed Sarkozy’s presidential effort. Arbitration Decision The matter stems from the 1993 sale of Tapie’s Adidas AG, which was handled by then-state-owned Credit Lyonnais SA. At the time, Lagarde was a partner with the Chicago-based law firm Baker & McKenzie LLP, 12 years before she joined the government. The minister has rejected accusations her decision to take the matter to arbitration and not appeal the award was a reward for Tapie’s support of Sarkozy. Europe is likely to succeed in getting Lagarde the job as developing nations are too divided to back a single candidate, said economist Nouriel Roubini. “The Europeans are going to be united in wanting a European, and I think the European candidate is going to be Christine Lagarde,” Roubini, who predicted the recent global financial crisis, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Last Word” with Andrea Catherwood yesterday."

"South Africa's ex-finance minister slams Europe's hold on IMF, won't say whether he wants job By Donna Bryson, The Associated Press – 18 minutes ago JOHANNESBURG — A South African who could be in line to lead the International Monetary Fund is joining calls for the West to relinquish its hold on the financial body's leadership. Trevor Manuel, who earned praise during his 1996-2009 tenure as South Africa's finance minister, told state TV Monday that developing countries were playing an increasingly important role in the global economy, and that it is ""fundamentally wrong"" that ""birthright is more important than ability"" in choosing the IMF chief. A European has headed the institution since the first managing director was named in 1946, a tradition developing countries are criticizing. An American has traditionally held the top job at the IMF's sister agency, the World Bank. ""The old order has to pass,"" Manuel said. Manuel's name has come up often as a possible successor to France's Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who stepped down as IMF head because he faces charges in New York he tried to rape a hotel maid. Strauss-Kahn denies charges. State TV reports Manuel would not say Monday whether he's seeking the IMF job. Mexico has said it will nominate the head of its central bank to lead the IMF. Over the weekend, South Africa and Australia — co-chairs of an IMF reform committee of the Group of 20 leading rich and developing countries — said merit, not nationality, should be the main criteria in replacing Strauss-Kahn. But Europe is unlikely to give up easily, especially at a time of debt crisis in the eurozone, where the fund is playing an important role in dealing with the problem.

"Anne Sinclair, 62, has stood by her man through many a brush with disaster. One of France's richest heiresses and its biggest TV news celebrity until she stood aside for Mr Strauss-Kahn's career in 1997, the maternal Ms Sinclair is now devoting herself to extracting her ""Domi"" from his biggest mess in a career of chance-taking. Once again, France has been impressed by the grit - and forbearance - of the woman Le Figaro this week likened to Hillary Clinton, the unshakeable half of a mutually dependent power couple. ""Anne Sinclair is a woman with an amiable nature, but if anyone touches her Domi, she becomes an attack dog,"" said L'Express magazine. There were certain to be fireworks when Ms Sinclair confronted ""DSK"" inside the Manhattan court. A popular French radio comedian imitated him saying he would prefer to face the New York prosecutor than his wife. Start of sidebar. Skip to end of sidebar. End of sidebar. Return to start of sidebar. However, there was no doubt that Ms Sinclair would once again put aside her emotions and help her chronically wayward husband. She usually turns a blind eye to his extra-marital pursuits, friends say. ""Anne is in a strategy of denial about Dominique's adventures. We hardly ever talk about it,"" one told Paris Match magazine. Until she was telephoned at a celebrity birthday party in Paris on Sunday, the New York-born Ms Sinclair was helping her husband into the final straight towards their ultimate dream: winning the French presidency next May. Mr Strauss-Kahn was the favourite to beat incumbent Nicolas Sarkozy, although his star had started to wane. Ever since Ms Sinclair met and married the brilliant but erratic socialist MP two decades ago, she had groomed him for the highest office. Initially she introduced him to the Paris power set in which she reigned as the host of the celebrated Sunday night political show Sept-sur-Sept (Seven on Seven). Her blue-eyed glamour even led her to become a model for Marianne, the symbol of the Republic. In 2006, when Mr Strauss-Kahn made his first, unsuccessful, bid for the Socialist Party nomination (won by Segolene Royal), the one-time super-journalist said: ""This is his combat, his life, so I accompany him."" That included helping to finance his team from her fortune, estimated in the dozens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars, inherited from her maternal grandfather. In Washington and on the Paris scene, Ms Sinclair was doing such an impressive job as her husband's most devoted promoter that some suggested she wanted the Elysee Palace more than he did. Then she heard the subdued voice from a New York police station at 11pm on Saturday. ""Domi"" told her sheepishly he did not understand what was happening, but ""it's serious"". She was shattered, but pulled herself together, according to Le Monde. Along with the couple's Paris lawyer and Anne Hommel, their spokeswoman, Ms Sinclair plunged into damage control and co-ordinated with the New York legal team. They flew to Manhattan on Monday, putting up E1 million ($1.34m) of her money as bail. Ms Sinclair then put out a statement saying: ""Do not believe for a single second the accusations against my husband."" The Times"

Below is a list of potential candidates to succeed the Frenchman at the Washington-based institution. The post has traditionally gone to a European, but with emerging market economies playing a greater role in the world economy, there is rising pressure to throw open the process to all member countries. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, however, signalled on Monday that she preferred another European at the helm of the IMF, which has become heavily involved in bailouts of struggling euro zone countries Greece, Ireland and Portugal. KEMAL DERVIS (TURKEY) Seen as a leading candidate for the IMF post if it goes to a non-European. Dervis is credited with bringing Turkey back from the brink after a 2001 financial crisis, by pushing through tough reforms and helping secure a multibillion dollar IMF bailout. Turkey's status as a large emerging market within the European continent could ease widespread concerns by developing nations who feel shut out of the IMF selection process because of Europe's claim to the top job. Dervis left Turkey to join the World Bank in 1978, becoming vice president of the institution in 1996. He returned home to much fanfare in 2001 as economy minister when Ankara faced failing banks, soaring inflation and a massive currency devaluation. Continued...

"TOKYO May 17 (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund's financial support measures for European countries are likely to proceed smoothly despite the arrest of the institution's chief, Japanese Economics Minister Kaoru Yosano said on Tuesday. The IMF should be able to tackle the European sovereign debt crisis because it is working closely with other European central banks, Yosano said. IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn was denied bail on Monday on charges he tried to rape a hotel maid, a crushing blow for a man who oversees the world economy and was tipped to be France's next president.

I think also of my colleagues at the Fund; together we have accomplished such great things over the last three years and more.

66	"Europe, developing world square off over IMF post"	"Lagarde is “practically a shoo-in” as the European Union’s candidate to succeed Dominique Strauss-Kahn as IMF managing director, an EU source said.
Brazil’s Finance Minister Guido Mantega on Friday sounded a compromising tone, writing in the newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo that a candidate, from Europe or emerging country, should in any case agree to end the US-EU pact over the top posts at the World Bank and IMF “in the next term."	"WASHINGTON — French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde was emerging Friday as Europe’s choice as the battle raged between advanced and emerging economic powers over who should lead the International Monetary Fund. Lagarde is “practically a shoo-in” as the European Union’s candidate to succeed Dominique Strauss-Kahn as IMF managing director, an EU source said. An EU announcement was expected at next week’s Group of Eight summit in France, the source said. “We should get such a signal at Deauville,” said the source, referring to the French beach resort where the two-day summit of the world’s eight top industrialized powers opens Thursday. The G8 gathers Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia and the United States. Strauss-Kahn’s resignation earlier this week to fight sex charges in New York has opened up a scramble for the top job. Emerging economic powers like China, India and Brazil are calling for an end to Europe’s lock on the position, the product of a 65-year-old gentleman’s agreement that allowed Washington to monopolize the World Bank presidency. Beijing’s state media on Friday carried calls for the next IMF chief to be Chinese, with one editorial saying the economic powerhouse has “a large number of people capable of holding the position.” Angel Gurria, the Mexican head of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, said Friday the time had come to change the tradition of who leads the agency. “I think that this time it is possible but it must be done quickly,” he said. On Thursday India’s executive director at the IMF warned that well-qualified candidates might not bother to stand for the post if it is already certain to go to a European. “There are a lot of people who feel that the process has not been credible,” he told AFP. “The kind of people I know who meet the criteria will just not take a chance if they know X or Y has already been selected,” he said. But with five EU members, including Ireland, Greece and now Portugal currently under massive IMF bailouts, Europe wants someone who like Strauss-Kahn could take a central role in rescuing the troubled EU “periphery” economies. “Europe owes it to itself to act quickly,” the EU source said. The position is a crucial one in the world economy. The global lender of last resort, the IMF each year lends tens of billions of dollars to troubled countries to help right their economies when no others will help them. But it also lays down strict standards of fiscal and economic reform for its clients which can upset political and social systems. While developing countries have not coalesced behind one individual, favorites include Turkish former UN official Kemal Dervis, Indian planner Montek Singh Ahluwalia and Mexican central banker Agustin Carstens. Another name which was circulating was Leszek Balcerowicz, the pioneer of Poland’s transition from communism to the free market. But they could have a tough time against Lagarde, who is widely respected in global financial circles and well-liked by the United States — which controls nearly 17 percent of the voting power on the IMF executive board. “The EU does not have another candidate, there is no fallback,” the EU source added. Outgoing European Central Bank president Jean-Claude Trichet, also French, is “not a candidate” and would not have strong support; and Germany, Europe’s powerhouse economy, “does not have a candidate and won’t have one,” the source said. Brazil’s Finance Minister Guido Mantega on Friday sounded a compromising tone, writing in the newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo that a candidate, from Europe or emerging country, should in any case agree to end the US-EU pact over the top posts at the World Bank and IMF “in the next term.” “The important thing is that the new director of the IMF continues the reforms of Strauss-Kahn, the democratization of the Fund,” he said."
67	Europe to decide soon on common candidate for head of IMF: German Finance Minister	"The minister was said by a source on Thursday to have a ""very high opinion"" of the French frontrunner to head the Washington-based lender, Finance Minister Christine Lagarde.

"BERLIN: German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said on Friday that Europe would decide soon on a common candidate to become the next head of the International Monetary Fund . ""We need a common European candidate and we are looking for the one who is best qualified and has the best chance,"" he told reporters. ""A decision will definitely come soon."" Schaeuble said Germany had ""not given up on presenting a candidate of its own"" to succeed Dominique Strauss-Kahn , but was in favour of European countries taking a joint decision on whom to present. The minister was said by a source on Thursday to have a ""very high opinion"" of the French frontrunner to head the Washington-based lender, Finance Minister Christine Lagarde . But the official German government position is that, while Chancellor Angela Merkel holds Lagarde in high esteem, no decision has been made on who will get the top job at the IMF . A Reuters poll of economists showed on Thursday that 32 of 56 thought Lagarde was most likely to succeed Strauss-Kahn. Lagarde declined to say whether she was interested, but told reporters: ""Any candidacy, whichever it is, must come from Europeans jointly, all together.""

68	A police car is parked outside the building where former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn is being held under house arrest in New York. — AFP	"FORMER IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who eight days ago was one of the most powerful men on the planet, spent his first full day as an electronically tagged, armed guarded, rape suspect yesterday at a temporary address in Manhattan — a flat equipped (at his expense) with sensitive alarms and 24-hour CCTV to deter him from fleeing."	"FORMER IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who eight days ago was one of the most powerful men on the planet, spent his first full day as an electronically tagged, armed guarded, rape suspect yesterday at a temporary address in Manhattan — a flat equipped (at his expense) with sensitive alarms and 24-hour CCTV to deter him from fleeing. Not that he is likely to do so. And, to make sure he can't so much as slip out for a sandwich, he is forbidden to leave the premises. All this for a man who, just over a week ago, was sitting in a business class seat of an Air France flight to Paris, whiling away the time before take-off, according to one report, by making a loud remark about the shape of one of the female cabin crew. Then, 10 minutes before scheduled departure, police entered and hauled him off for questioning about the alleged attempted rape, sexual assault and false imprisonment of a maid at New York's Sofitel hotel. He has since been charged with attempted rape and assault, the most serious count of which carries a maximum sentence of 25 years. He denies all charges, but resigned from the International Monetary Fund last week. Officials from that office, according to the New York Times, said on Friday that at least two other Sofitel employees have claimed that Strauss-Kahn “made advances toward them during his stay”. Wife ‘mortgages mansion to raise bail bond’ Washington: Disgraced former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn's wife has put her mansion in the US on the block to raise US dollars six million as bail bond to get her husband, facing sexual assault charges, released from New York's Rikers Island prison, a media report said.The 62-year-old French politician's bail was set at US dollars one million in cash and a US dollars five million insurance bond, which his wife, heiress and French television presenter Anne Sinclair, raised by mortgaging her mansion in Washington DC, the 'Daily Mail' online reported. If her husband absconds, she will forfeit the money and the house in the exclusive Georgetown district, which she bought in 2007 for US dollars four million, the report said. His wife is also understood to be paying the rent for his “golden cage” — an exclusive block of flats near the site of the former World Trade Center, the report said. — PTI Whatever evidence is finally accumulated, neither he nor his accuser could escape the continued build-up of hearsay and online speculation about their pasts. New claims about Strauss-Kahn's behaviour towards women are contained in a 5,000-word Reuters special report which was released late on Friday. While containing much praise for his achievements at the IMF (former German official Stefan Collignon said he was “a genius in getting economics and policy together”), there was much about his incorrigible pursuit of women, regardless, sometimes, of whether they wanted his attentions or not. There was his affair with Hungarian economist and IMF staffer Piroska Nagy, which, says Reuters, was a brief, and - by her - bitterly regretted fling in Davos. “Margaux”, a former student at the prestigious Sciences Po university in Paris, where Strauss-Kahn taught for two years, said: “It was known he was a ladies' man, but I never heard anything concrete.” Still, she recalled being made to feel ill at ease by a “diabolic and severe” look Strauss-Kahn gave female students sitting in the front row. A former IMF official told Reuters that when Strauss-Kahn arrived at the IMF, ""women were deliberately careful not to be alone around him"". There was an understanding in the IMF press department never to leave a female reporter alone with DSK, just in case something inappropriate happened. The one relief for the former IMF chief and his legal team came from France, where the lawyer for a French writer who alleged Strauss-Kahn had sexually assaulted her eight years ago has said she won't file a criminal complaint against him, for now. David Koubbi, who represents Tristane Banon, 31, said: “Our decision has been reserved for later for a simple reason: neither Tristane Banon nor I want to be manipulated by the American justice system. Meanwhile, the alleged victim in New York is herself the subject of much speculation, mostly online. She is known to be a 32-year-old West African-born single mother with a daughter of 15, who has been in the US for a number of years. Just how many differs according to the accounts, as does her status (immigrant or asylum seeker), marital past (widow or divorcee), and even her health. Some reports say she has lived in apartments in buildings reserved for those who are HIV-positive, something strenuously denied. More disturbingly, her identity is widely asserted online, often accompanied by photographs purporting to be of her. She is staying with her daughter at a secret location and, says her lawyer, vigorously contests Strauss-Kahn's claims that what passed between them in Suite 2806 at the Sofitel was in any way consensual. The prosecutor, John McConnell, says the maid tells “a compelling and unwavering story” Such was the seriousness of the charges, and the fact Strauss-Kahn had been apprehended sitting on a plane just about to taxi on to a runway, that it took all week for his lawyers to successfully argue that he could be granted bail. He spent most of the time in a cell on Rikers Island, and when he was released, it was into a farcical toing and froing over his and his wife's first choice accommodation. The plan was for Strauss-Kahn to move into a luxury residential hotel under armed guard on Manhattan's well-to-do Upper East Side. Even though the address was never officially released, police and media converged on the building, the Bristol Plaza at 210 East 65th Street, and that, in effect, scuppered any chance of him enjoying the rooftop health club, Italian marble bathrooms, flat-screen televisions, king-size beds with goose-down pillows, which are a feature of the place. His next court appearance, at which he will formally answer the charges against him, is set to be on June 6. — By arrangement with The Independent"

The major market indexes initially pointed higher in pre-market action, with Home Depot (HD) leading a modest earnings celebration ahead of the bell. However, a ho-hum profit forecast from fellow blue chip Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) quickly rained on the bulls' parade, sending stocks reeling right out of the gate. Adding insult to injury, a surprise drop in new home starts, as well as disappointing data on industrial production, also rattled the Street's cage. Meanwhile, escalating fears about European sovereign debt, on top of uncertainty -- and controversial sound bites -- about the fate of International Monetary Fund (IMF) chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn, bolstered the buck, which sent dollar-denominated assets like crude oil and gold into a tailspin. While an eleventh-hour rebound helped the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite (COMP) eke out a fractional gain by the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) wasn't as fortunate, with the blue-chip barometer surrendering almost 0.6% by the time the bell mercifully sounded.

 
 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA ? 12,479.58) trimmed its triple-digit deficit in afternoon trading, but still ended on a loss of 68.8 points, or 0.6%, to settle south of 12,500 for the first time since April 25. Hewlett-Packard -- unsurprisingly -- led the 14 laggards with a 7.3% drop, while JPMorgan Chase (JPM) paced the 16 advancing equities with a gain of nearly 2.2%.

The S&P 500 Index (SPX ? 1,328.98) also chipped away at its intraday deficit in late-session trading, giving up just 0.5 point, or 0.04%, by the close. Helping the broad-market barometer climb out of the doldrums was its 10-week moving average, which hasn't been compromised on a weekly closing basis since mid-March. Finally, the Nasdaq Composite (COMP ? 2,783.21) bucked the trend, clawing its way to a fractional gain of 0.9 point, or 0.03%, in the final hour of trading. Nevertheless, the tech-rich COMP is still in danger of ending the week south of its 10-week trendline for the first time since late March.

Crude futures ended lower again today, after a dose of discouraging economic data fueled concerns about ebbing demand. In addition, many buyers sat on the sidelines ahead of tomorrow's weekly crude inventories report, with most economists calling for a week-over-week increase in domestic supplies. By the close, June-dated crude oil futures surrendered 46 cents, or 0.5%, to end at $96.91 per barrel.

Gold futures finished a choppy session at a five-week nadir today, as a strengthening greenback spooked foreign-currency holders from the dollar-denominated asset. In addition, the malleable metal retreated after several large hedge funds -- including Soros Fund Management -- revealed that they've reduced their stakes in the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD). By the time the dust settled, gold for June delivery gave up $10.60, or 0.7%, to end at $1,480 an ounce -- the front-month contract's lowest settlement price since April 14. July-dated silver futures followed suit, backpedaling 64 cents, or 1.9%, to finish at $33.49 an ounce -- the contract's lowest closing price since Feb. 25.

72	Nina In New York: This Place Is A Zoo	#NAME?	"(Alligator (credit: AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee)) Alligator (credit: AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee) - SHARE IT! - Email - Reddit - - Digg - Twitter - A young professional’s take on the trials and tribulations of everyday life in New York City. ______________________________________________________________ It’s been a real menagerie around here lately. First Mia the Bronx Zoo cobra slithered her way out of her cage and into our nightmares. I mean hearts. She is back where she belongs behind a wall of glass which we can only hope is impenetrable. If her constant and savvy presence on Twitter is any indication, it seems she’s gotten smarter since her first breakout attempt and will not rest until she’s free—and climbing up your toilet. Not long after, a female peacock—or rather peahen—sauntered off the zoo grounds and spent a few blissful days bopping around the Bronx , snacking on discarded food, narrowly avoiding vehicular death, and generally bemusing residents with her casual presence. And of course, again with the Twitter. Though unlike Mia, who uses her platform to stretch her comedic…er, legs…@BronxZooPeacock appears to be gearing up for a political announcement leading into 2012. [Insert obvious joke comparing peacocks to politicians here.] Then there was the seal, who visited us for a brief time but soon took off down the Hudson River once more. She’s probably docking in Seaside Heights right about now, looking for a decent rental near the boardwalk. She is going to be super disappointed once she hears that MTV’s Jersey Shore “juicehead gorillas” are off in Italy right now, reinforcing negative American stereotypes among Europeans (while Monsieur Strauss-Kahn returns the favor on our turf ). Of course, there’s Unsinkable Molly Brown—the calico cat who washed up on Governor’s Island after a storm last month who has been adopted by her new home and roams around like she owns the place. And we can’t forget the baby peregrine falcons who hatched on top of a skyscraper down on Water Street. We like them because they’re fuzzy, they’re cute, they’re endangered, one of them is named after a fallen Marine, and apparently they eat pigeons when they get older. Now there’s a little bitty two-and-a-half foot alligator who has escaped an illegal pet situation and has been rescued from the Long Island Expressway, which is excellent both for the well-being of the alligator and due to the aforementioned toilet-climbing possibilities. He doesn’t have a name or a Twitter feed, though…yet. Who’s next? I feel like we’re all about to be in one of those ridiculous movie scenes where all the animals get together and escape from their tiny cages at the old-fashioned, horribly cruel-looking zoo and go parading down the streets, elephants and lions and monkeys and giraffes all marching together and causing all sorts of good-natured mayhem. They make lots of noise and all the townspeople gasp and gawp and the children laugh and point and then everyone throws a big party. Of course, in the real version, a whole bunch of people and beasts would likely wind up getting mauled and shot, respectively, so let’s try to avoid this. In the meantime, I am going to start a boutique social media personal PR firm for escaped and/or misplaced zoological species in New York City. I smell a goldmine somewhere in here.

73	"Strauss-Kahn Resigns As IMF Chief, Says To Prove Innocence"	"Related Stories Dominique Strauss-Kahn resigned as head of the International Monetary Fund, saying he needed to devote all his energy to fight charges that he sexually assaulted a hotel maid.
""I deny with the greatest possible firmness all of the allegations that have been made against me,"" Strauss-Kahn said in his letter of resignation, released by the IMF and dated May 18.
The woman Strauss-Kahn allegedly tried to rape, a 32-year-old widow from West Africa, testified on Wednesday before a grand jury."	"Related Stories Dominique Strauss-Kahn resigned as head of the International Monetary Fund, saying he needed to devote all his energy to fight charges that he sexually assaulted a hotel maid. His arrest after he was pulled from a plane in New York on Saturday dashes Strauss-Kahn's prospects of running for the French presidency in 2012 and has sparked debate around the world over the Fund's future leadership. ""I deny with the greatest possible firmness all of the allegations that have been made against me,"" Strauss-Kahn said in his letter of resignation, released by the IMF and dated May 18. ""I want to devote all my strength, all my time, and all my energy to proving my innocence."" Later on Thursday, the former French finance minister will make his second request to be allowed out of jail on $1 million cash bail and placed under 24-hour house arrest until his trial on charges of attempting to rape a hotel maid, his lawyers said. He is being held in New York's Rikers Island jail. ""Yes there will definitely be a bail hearing tomorrow,"" Manhattan District Attorney's Office spokeswoman Erin Duggan told Reuters on Wednesday. A police mug shot of Strauss-Kahn, 62, taken more than 24 hours after he was detained, showed him exhausted, his eyes downcast and half-closed and wearing a rumpled, open-neck shirt. The photograph is likely to fuel outrage in France over the way the man seen as a strong contender for the French presidency was paraded before the cameras in what is called the ""perp walk"" before he had a chance to defend himself in court. Polls released in France on Wednesday showed 57 percent of respondents thought the Socialist politician was definitely, or probably, the victim of a plot. The woman Strauss-Kahn allegedly tried to rape, a 32-year-old widow from West Africa, testified on Wednesday before a grand jury. It will decide in secret whether there is enough evidence to formally press charges with an indictment. TIMELINE EMERGES New details have emerged about the sequence of events surrounding the alleged attack. Strauss-Kahn left the Sofitel near Times Square in Manhattan around 12:30 p.m. on Saturday and about an hour later, hotel security called police to report an alleged sexual assault, a law enforcement source said. New York investigators are questioning why officials at the hotel waited an hour to call police after the IMF chief had left in a hurry. He has been charged with attempted rape, sexual abuse, a criminal sexual act, unlawful imprisonment and forcible touching. If convicted, he could face 25 years in prison. The woman he is accused of assaulting is an asylum seeker from Guinea with a 15-year-old daughter. In the only public hint of Strauss-Kahn's possible line of defense, his attorney Benjamin Brafman told his arraignment hearing on Monday that the evidence ""will not be consistent with a forcible encounter."" Any trial could be six months or more away. WHO WILL NEXT HEAD IMF? Strauss-Kahn's resignation will intensify the debate over who should next lead the Fund and whether it is time to ditch the tradition, in place since it was set up in 1945, of having a European as managing director. Emerging market economies, which are anyway demanding a greater say in how the IMF is run, have also been pressing their case for the global economy's financial manager to be drawn from their ranks. China, Brazil and South Africa have all suggested a new approach to selecting to next managing director. Strauss-Kahn's departure comes at a sensitive time given the IMF's dominant role in helping euro zone states like Greece, Ireland and Portugal deal with massive debt problems. And Europeans argue that because of the euro zone debt crisis it makes sense for them to retain the post. John Lipsky, the Fund's number two, is acting managing director until the IMF executive board selects a successor to Strauss-Kahn. Source: Reuters"

At the initial hearing, prosecutors opposed the defense bail offer of $1 million and surrender of Strauss-Kahn's travel documents."	"New York: The grand jury deciding whether or not to send IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn to trial has until Friday to decide. Currently the French politician is being held in jail following his initial court hearing on Monday. On Friday he is due in court to hear the results of the grand jury decision, seven days from his arrest on May 14th. If the grand jury believes there is insufficient evidence to hold a trial, he will be freed. But if the grand jurors believe the prosecution argument has foundation, then the court will be presented with an indictment containing at least one felony charge. The contents of the indictment will remain secret at that hearing. The charges could have changed from those laid out in the complaint already filed against him. The judge at New York State court will set a new hearing date, typically 10 days to two weeks ahead. At that hearing, the indictment is unsealed and the defendant enters a formal guilty or not guilty plea. If the plea is not guilty then preparations for a jury trial begin. Strauss-Kahn has already denied the charges against him and vowed to fight them in court. In the meantime, Strauss-Kahn remains incarcerated without bail because a judge on Monday deemed him liable to attempt escape to France, which does not extradite citizens to the United States. His lawyers can appeal this. However, a spokeswoman for the District Attorney's office said that a judge was unlikely to overturn another judge's decision unless prosecutors came to an agreement with defense attorneys. At the initial hearing, prosecutors opposed the defense bail offer of $1 million and surrender of Strauss-Kahn's travel documents. The prosecution spokeswoman said: ""Nothing has changed.""

"(Dominique Strauss-Kahn) Dominique Strauss-Kahn is believed to have left his hotel about an hour before an alleged assault on a chambermaid was reported to police. Photograph: Emmanuel Dunand/AFP/Getty Images New York investigators are questioning why the Sofitel hotel in New York waited an hour to call police after the International Monetary Fund chief, Dominique Strauss-Kahn , left the hotel in a hurry on Saturday after an alleged sexual assault of a chambermaid. A law enforcement source said investigators believed that the Sofitel maid entered Strauss-Kahn's penthouse suite shortly after midday. Hotel video and witness accounts show Strauss-Kahn left the hotel by 12.30pm without visiting the front desk to check out and hailed a yellow cab. The source said investigators believed the maid reported the alleged assault to several other members of staff almost immediately. The hotel's first call to a police emergency number was received at 1:32pm, according to official reports cited by the law enforcement source. During the 911 call, hotel security said they wanted to report an alleged sexual assault. The first police units arrived at the hotel 13 minutes later, the source said. The law enforcement source said the hotel might have waited to phone police because the alleged victim was so upset, and her report of mistreatment so startling, that it took managers an hour before they felt comfortable alerting authorities about her claims. Strauss-Kahn, who has resigned as IMF chief, is being held at Rikers Island prison in New York on charges of attempted rape and sexual assault. He was a frontrunner for the French presidency before his arrest. Officials at the Sofitel in New York were not immediately available for comment. Police are investigating Strauss-Kahn's movements between his exit from the hotel and the moment when Port Authority officers, who patrol New York's John F Kennedy airport, boarded his Paris-bound aircraft. In a new bail application filed with an appeal court on Wednesday, lawyers for Strauss-Kahn said their client checked out of the Sofitel at 12:28pm and headed to a previously scheduled lunch ""a few blocks away"" at around 12.45pm. The law enforcement source said investigators believe that Strauss-Kahn phoned the Sofitel at 3.30pm, presumably from the airport, and asked if he had left anything at the hotel. Police at the hotel requested Sofitel staff to ask Strauss-Kahn to tell them where he was and to say that they had his mobile phone and would bring it to him. Instead, New York police arranged with the Port Authority to have Strauss-Kahn's plane held at the gate until detectives arrived. Port Authority officers boarded the aircraft around 4.30pm and quietly asked Strauss-Kahn to disembark. Once off the plane, the IMF chief was turned over to detectives, who handcuffed him and took him in an unmarked car to a police station in the Harlem area of Manhattan, which houses specialists who investigate alleged sex crimes."

78	IMF board to begin selection of new chief Thursday	"IMF board to begin selection of new chief Thursday Posted at: 05/19/2011 2:06 PM By CHRISTOPHER S. RUGABER and MARTIN CRUTSINGER (AP) WASHINGTON - The International Monetary Fund's 24-member executive board will meet Thursday to begin the process of selecting a new leader, said John Lipsky, the IMF's acting managing director."	"IMF board to begin selection of new chief Thursday Posted at: 05/19/2011 2:06 PM By CHRISTOPHER S. RUGABER and MARTIN CRUTSINGER (AP) WASHINGTON - The International Monetary Fund's 24-member executive board will meet Thursday to begin the process of selecting a new leader, said John Lipsky, the IMF's acting managing director. ""We want this to happen as expeditiously as possible,"" Lipsky said. His comments came shortly after Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner urged the IMF to quickly select a new chief through an open process. Lipsky took over this week after former chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn was accused of sexually assaulting a hotel maid. Strauss-Kahn, who is has denied the charges, resigned late Wednesday. That set up a scramble to choose his successor. Traditionally, the head of the IMF has been a European while an American has run the World Bank. Developing countries have long chafed at that arrangement and are pushing for officials from their countries to be considered this time. The United States will play a critical role in the selection. The U.S. has the most votes among any individual country, although collectively Europe carries the most weight. Geithner's statement was ambiguous and leaves open the possibility that the U.S. could support a candidate from either group. Some analysts said the U.S. government will make its preference clearer behind the scenes while keeping a more impartial stance in public. Lipsky stressed that the work of the IMF has gone on for the full week despite the uncertainty over Strauss-Kahn. He said that IMF board, in addition to dealing with the search process for a successor, had a meeting scheduled for Friday to review an emergency loan program for Portugal, one of three European nations whose huge debt burdens have required them to turn to the IMF for help. Lipsky said the IMF faces ""unique challenges of the moment."" But it has a highly qualified staff that is fully capable of carrying on the work of the organization, he said. ""Our cadre of department heads is the best this institution has ever had,"" Lipsky said. The IMF is heavily involved in delicate negotiations over financial assistance to troubled European countries such as Greece, Portugal and Ireland. The European governments are coalescing behind French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde. (Copyright 2011 by The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.)"
79	'IMF to appoint new chief by June 30'	"The IMF said late Friday that the selection process for a new managing director will kick off with open nominations on May 23, after the resignation of Dominique Strauss-Kahn, following the 62-year-old French politician's arrest and indictment on charges of sexually assaulting a New York hotel maid, which has sparked a leadership race to replace him."	"The board would accept nominations to the position until June 10 and then narrow the candidates to a list of three for final consideration, The New York Times quoted Shakour Shaalan, head of the board, as saying in a statement on Friday. The IMF said late Friday that the selection process for a new managing director will kick off with open nominations on May 23, after the resignation of Dominique Strauss-Kahn, following the 62-year-old French politician's arrest and indictment on charges of sexually assaulting a New York hotel maid, which has sparked a leadership race to replace him. US Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said the United States wanted the post to be filled quickly and would support a candidate who could command broad support from countries. ""We are consulting broadly with the Fund's shareholders from emerging markets, as well as advanced economies,"" he said. ""We are prepared to support a candidate with the requisite, deep experience and leadership qualities, and who can command broad support among the Fund's membership. It is important that this be an open process and one that moves quickly to select new leadership for the IMF."" The IMF said in a statement, ""Former Managing Director Strauss-Kahn's annual pension and related entitlements have been grossly over-estimated in media reports this week, and appear based erroneously on a one-off separation payment of $250,000. And the annual payments would be far, far less than that amount in subsequent years."" Some of Strauss-Kahn's closest allies, however, claim that the IMF chief was the subject of a smear campaign at a time when opinion polls, including one by French daily le Parisien suggest that 45 percent of the French people think him as the country's next president.

80	"Posh, pricey NYC house arrest for ex-IMF leader"	"This is Dominique Strauss-Kahn 's new jail away from jail, after the former IMF leader charged with sexually assaulting a maid left a New York City jail for a posh and pricey house arrest.
Even with the severe restrictions, Strauss-Kahn's family wealth has afforded him one of the cushiest bail agreements possible.
"" But the freedom from jail meant dealing with the press - and lawyers in Strauss-Kahn's case said the international media frenzy over his case changed the house arrest plans."	"NEW YORK (AP) -- Armed guards stand watch 24 hours a day. Cameras record every move, and monitors alert authorities should the prisoner try to escape. This is Dominique Strauss-Kahn's new jail away from jail, after the former IMF leader charged with sexually assaulting a maid left a New York City jail for a posh and pricey house arrest. The plans hit a snag Friday when a tony Upper East Side apartment complex refused to accept the one-time French presidential candidate because of unwanted media attention. Instead, Strauss-Kahn was ensconced Saturday in a lower Manhattan high-rise within the New York Police Department's ring of steel, a network of private and police cameras. He's guarded by Stroz Friedberg, the same security firm that kept disgraced financier Bernard Madoff under surveillance in his own penthouse. It's not clear when and where he'd be moved to a more permanent house arrest; calls to his attorney and to the security firm weren't returned Saturday. Even with the severe restrictions, Strauss-Kahn's family wealth has afforded him one of the cushiest bail agreements possible. But it won't come cheap. The cost to secure the former International Monetary Fund chief was estimated at about $200,000 a month - and he must foot the bill. In comparison, it costs the city about $6,500 a month to house an inmate at a facility like Rikers Island, where he has been held nearly a week. The funds will go toward armed surveillance, the installation of cameras and a special bracelet shackled to his ankle that will set off an alarm if he travels too far. Right now, he's not allowed out at all, but after he's moved to a more permanent location he can leave for court, doctor visits and weekly religious services. Prosecutors must be notified at least six hours before he goes anywhere. He can't be out between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. And he won't be lonely: Strauss-Kahn can take visitors - up to four at a time in addition to family. The 62-year-old was indicted by a grand jury this week on charges including criminal sexual abuse and attempted rape in the alleged attack last weekend at the Sofitel near Manhattan's Times Square. He was held at the jail initially because a judge sided with prosecutors who believed he was a substantial flight risk, given his wealth and international status, and worried if he was simply released he'd flee to France, which has extradition laws that favor its residents. His lawyers initially requested his release on $1 million bail, but revised the plan later in the week to add stricter house arrest restrictions. State Supreme Justice Michael J. Obus signed off on the plan and ordered Strauss-Kahn's release from Rikers Island on Friday. A spokeswoman for Stroz Friedberg had no comment on their latest client. The company has a history of high-stakes, high-wealth clients: It secured Mahender and Varsha Sabhnani, a rich Long Island couple convicted of enslaving two domestic servants they brought from Indonesia by keeping their travel documents while having them perform forced labor. Over the course of the couple's home detention, the firm was chastised by a judge for allowing Mahender Sabhnani to stay out at business meetings in Manhattan until 1 a.m. And then there's Madoff, who was under house arrest for over a year before he began serving a 150-year prison term in 2009 for swindling investors of billions. In a case study posted on its website on its involvement with Madoff, the company said round-the-clock monitoring was done by retired federal and high-ranking New York City officers who kept tabs on everything, from deliveries in and out of the building to recording his every move. Security experts say it would take at least three experienced guards to do the job well in Strauss-Kahn's case - two working at all times and one on reserve. ""You can't to go sleep. You need fresh guys all the time,"" said Beau Dietl, a longtime former NYPD detective who now does security and is a private eye. ""You can't let the guy out of your sight."" Nick Casale, who guarded Madoff initially, said the prisoner's wealth must be taken into account. ""For the average person, $1 million cash bail is astronomical. But you have to look at how this would impact his wealth, is it substantial, or is it trivial?"" Lawyers said in court Strauss-Kahn was worth about $2 million, but his wife, journalist Anne Sinclair, is substantially wealthy, and helped secure the $5 million bond the judge added to the bail agreement. Experts say such agreements are becoming increasingly common for well-heeled defendants - the most high-profile being Madoff, who was under private guard and had cameras trained on him 24 hours a day. Strauss-Kahn's lawyers cited the case - in which Madoff posted $10 million bail - as a reason to release the economist. Some other white-collar bail agreements make Madoff's look puny. In 2008, David Brooks, formerly the top supplier of body armor to the U.S. military, was released on $400 million bond under a house arrest term that called for electronic monitoring and an armed guard in his apartment. His bail was revoked in 2010 when a federal judge ruled that he had schemed to hide assets from the court. Raj Rajaratnam, a one-time billionaire hedge fund founder convicted of insider trading, is currently free on $100 million bail, but under house arrest at his Manhattan home while he awaits sentencing July 29. It's just a fact, experts say, that money can buy you a sweeter deal while you wait for your criminal case to go to trial. ""So now what we're saying is that people of status and class and power can perpetrate these type of crimes, hire an expensive legal team, and meet the conditions of bail to satisfy the court to secure their freedom,"" said Nick Casale, a security expert who guarded Madoff. ""Are we going to this caste system of defendants?"" But the freedom from jail meant dealing with the press - and lawyers in Strauss-Kahn's case said the international media frenzy over his case changed the house arrest plans. Strauss-Kahn decided not to move to the Upper East Side luxury building ""out of respect for the residents"" who objected to the international media converging on the complex, Strauss-Kahn attorney William Taylor said. On Friday, Donna Mancino said she couldn't get a working elevator to her apartment while Strauss-Kahn was being moved in. But she and other residents said the only disruptive aspect of his presence was the press staking him out. ""He has to stay somewhere - and there are a lot of criminals on Wall Street,"" she said. Strauss-Kahn is accused of attacking a 32-year-old housekeeper Saturday in his $3,000-a-night hotel suite. The West African immigrant told police he chased her down a hallway in the suite, forced her to perform oral sex and tried to remove her stockings. He is scheduled for arraignment on June 6. ---(equals) Associated Press Writer David B. Caruso contributed to this report. © 2011 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

81	Strauss-Kahn tastes freedom under house arrest	"NEW YORK—Former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn was spending his first day outside a prison Saturday after his lawyers posted $6 million bond in the wake of his indictment on sexual assault and attempted rape charges.
Lawyers for Strauss-Kahn convinced a judge on Thursday to release him on bail pending trial, under strict provisions."	"NEW YORK—Former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn was spending his first day outside a prison Saturday after his lawyers posted $6 million bond in the wake of his indictment on sexual assault and attempted rape charges. Strauss-Kahn was freed from New York’s Rikers Island jail on Friday, trading a jumpsuit for civilian clothes and an isolated cell for an apartment with visits from family and friends. The house arrest of the former IMF chief, who has been accused of sexually assaulting a hotel maid, was approved by a judge. Strauss-Kahn will live under the constant surveillance by the private security firm Stroz Friedberg at a secure building at the south end of Broadway near Ground Zero. Judge Michael Obus earlier ordered the 62-year-old veteran French politician to be released to the home detention after plans for him to live in a plush apartment rented by his wife, Anne Sinclair, reportedly fell through when residents in the complex objected. Obus agreed at a new hearing that Strauss-Kahn could be handed over to the security firm and put up in temporary accommodation until a more permanent apartment is found. He must wear an electronic monitoring bracelet at all times, be under at least one armed guard, and the apartment must have 24-hour video monitoring and alarms on all exterior doors. After almost a week in police custody, including four humiliating nights in Rikers, the move will bring Strauss-Kahn great relief as well as many of the trappings, if not the reality, of freedom. “Mr Strauss-Kahn will be permitted to leave his home and travel within Manhattan solely for the following reasons: scheduled court appearances, meetings with his counsel, medical appointments, and weekly religious observance,” the bail agreement said. An earlier provision that Strauss-Kahn had to give court officials 24 hours’ notice each time he wanted to leave his new digs was relaxed in favor of the defense to just six hours. Camille, Strauss-Kahn’s daughter by a previous marriage, lives in Manhattan on the Upper West Side as she completes her graduate studies at Columbia University. Lawyers for Strauss-Kahn convinced a judge on Thursday to release him on bail pending trial, under strict provisions. The veteran politician has resigned as head of the International Monetary Fund under the weight of a scandal that has also ended any hope he had of replacing Nicolas Sarkozy as French president in 2012. The case has sent ripples around the globe, setting off a heated battle between Europe and emerging powers over who should fill his role at the world lender, which is bailing out failing economies left, right and center. French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde is tipped as a likely successor but developing nations such as Brazil, Mexico and China have urged a rethink of the conventional wisdom that an IMF chief has to come from Europe. Tharman Shanmugaratnam, chairman of the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC), called Saturday for an “open” and “merit-based” selection process of a new IMF head. A grand jury voted to indict Strauss-Kahn on all seven charges related to the alleged sexual assault and attempted rape of the maid on Saturday in his luxury suite at Manhattan’s Sofitel hotel. Strauss-Kahn has denied all charges and is expected to enter a plea of not guilty at his next court appearance on June 6. He could spend the rest of his life in prison if found guilty. US media say police have taken forensic evidence from the hotel, including bodily fluids found on a section of rug where the alleged victim remembered spitting after she says Strauss-Kahn assaulted her and forced her to perform oral sex. Jeff Shapiro, a lawyer for Strauss-Kahn’s accuser, has said his 32-year-old client, who has not been identified except by some in the French media, was “alarmed” at the prospect of her alleged attacker leaving jail. She testified on Wednesday and Thursday before the grand jury that later decided to send the case to trial. If Strauss-Kahn was to plead guilty there would be no trial, but this is considered highly unlikely. His star lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said earlier this week the evidence “will not be consistent with a forcible encounter,” suggesting the defense was preparing to go to trial and could argue that whatever happened was consensual.

84	"NYC maid's lawyer: Assault complaint vs. IMF chief wasn't a setup, attack ruined her life"	"The man, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, remained jailed under a suicide watch Wednesday as a lawyer for the woman sought to rebut whispered allegations that her charges were a conspiracy and a setup.
On Tuesday her lawyer, Jeffrey Shapiro, said he had no doubts his client was telling the truth about her encounter with Strauss-Kahn on Saturday."	"She says she had no idea there was a man inside or that he was a famous French politician. She says he was naked, chased her down and tried to rape her. The man, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, remained jailed under a suicide watch Wednesday as a lawyer for the woman sought to rebut whispered allegations that her charges were a conspiracy and a setup. Calls intensified for the 62-year-old Strauss-Kahn to step down as head of the powerful International Monetary Fund, with U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner saying Strauss-Kahn ""is obviously not in a position to run"" the agency. Strauss-Kahn was one of France's most high-profile politicians and a potential candidate for president in next year's elections. His arrest on charges including attempted rape shocked France and cast intense attention on his accuser, a 32-year-old chambermaid from the West African nation of Guinea. On Tuesday her lawyer, Jeffrey Shapiro, said he had no doubts his client was telling the truth about her encounter with Strauss-Kahn on Saturday. ""She came from a country in which poor people had little or no justice, and she's now in a country where the poor have the same rights as do the rich and the powerful,"" Shapiro said. ""What (Strauss-Kahn) might be able to get away with in some countries, he can't here in this country."" Strauss-Kahn's lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said at his client's arraignment this week that defense lawyers believe the forensic evidence ""will not be consistent with a forcible encounter."" But Shapiro dismissed suggestions that the woman had made up the charges or tried to cover up a consensual encounter. ""This is nothing other than a physical, sexual assault by this man on this young woman,"" Shapiro said in an interview in his Manhattan office. He said that the woman didn't know who was staying in the 28th-floor suite she went to clean on Saturday afternoon, before she said she was attacked. ""She did not know who this man was until a day or two after this took place,"" Shapiro said. ""She had no idea who this man was."" Strauss-Kahn is also charged with sex abuse, a criminal sex act, unlawful imprisonment and forcible touching. The most serious charge carries five to 25 years in prison. Because of his high profile, he was being held Tuesday at Rikers Island in a section of the jail that normally houses prisoners with highly contagious diseases like measles or tuberculosis. Corrections spokesman Stephen Morello said Strauss-Kahn has been placed in a wing with about 14 cells, all of them empty except for his. Norman Seabrook, president of the correction officers union, said Strauss-Kahn did or said something during a mental health evaluation that concerned doctors, and he is being monitored day and night. A law enforcement official, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of prisoner medical information, said Strauss-Kahn had not tried to harm himself. Strauss-Kahn's cell has a toilet and a sink. He takes his meals there, with breakfast at 5 a.m., lunch at 11 a.m. and dinner at 4 or 5 p.m. Morello said Strauss-Kahn can occasionally leave his cell and wander the wing, and can go outside for an hour each day. Because he is awaiting trial, Strauss-Kahn isn't required to wear a prison uniform. He may bring his own clothing and wear what he chooses, except for his shoes. Meanwhile in Europe, Strauss-Kahn's past conduct with other women was getting new scrutiny. The IMF investigated him following a 2008 affair with an employee, the Hungarian-born economist Piroska Nagy. The institution eventually cleared him of wrongdoing, but a person close to Nagy said Tuesday that she had sent the organization a letter at the time warning about his behavior toward women. The letter voiced ""doubts about Dominique Strauss-Kahn's suitability for running an international institution,"" according to the person, who declined to be identified, citing the sensitivity of the matter. The New York Times published an excerpt of the letter, along with an account that said Strauss-Kahn had aggressively pursued Nagy, sent her sexually explicit messages and once had her summoned from the bathroom to speak to him. The scandal comes at a delicate time for the IMF, which is trying to shore up teetering economies in Europe. The IMF is an immensely powerful agency that loans money to countries to stabilize the world economy. In exchange it often imposes strict austerity measures. Strauss-Kahn seemed to anticipate that his problems with women could be a political liability ahead of France's presidential elections. The French daily newspaper Liberation reported this week that at a meeting with Strauss-Kahn in April, he speculated that his presidential campaign might be subjected to low blows over ""money, women and my Jewishness."" Strauss-Kahn also theorized that his enemies might try to pay someone to accuse him of rape, according to the newspaper. The Associated Press does not name victims of alleged sex crimes unless they agree to it. But in the days since the alleged attack in Manhattan, details are beginning to emerge about Strauss-Kahn's accuser. The woman came to the United States under ""very difficult circumstances"" in 2004 from Guinea, one of the world's most destitute countries, said Shapiro, her lawyer. Guinea's average annual income of $1,000 per person is lower than Haiti's and Rwanda's and about the same as Afghanistan's, according to the CIA World Factbook. The woman's daughter, then 8, came with her. The girl's father is dead, and they have no other relatives in the United States, Shapiro said. ""They are very much alone in this world,"" he said. The United States gave the pair political asylum, he said, though he was unsure of the reason. The woman found work as a chambermaid in hotels, he said, eventually landing a job in 2008 at the French-owned Sofitel Hotel on 44th Street in Manhattan. The hotel said she was a satisfactory employee. The woman and her daughter moved into an apartment building in the Bronx about 10 months ago, said Zulema Zuniga, who lives on the same floor. The neighbors would occasionally meet in the elevator and say hello. ""She was very nice,"" Zuniga said. But this humble immigrant life was shattered, police say, on Saturday afternoon, when the woman entered Strauss-Kahn's suite at the Sofitel to clean the room. Strauss-Kahn came out of the bathroom naked, chased her down a hallway and pulled her into a bedroom, the woman told police. Then he dragged her into a bathroom, forced her to perform oral sex on him and tried to remove her underwear, she said. She broke free, fled the room and told hotel security, but Strauss-Kahn was gone by the time detectives arrived, authorities said. They arrested him soon afterward on an airliner that was just about to depart for Europe. Brafman said he is confident his client will be exonerated once all the physical evidence is collected. Shapiro, a personal injury attorney, said he was put in touch with the woman through a mutual acquaintance. He said they had not discussed the possibility of a civil lawsuit against Strauss-Kahn. Media attention has made it impossible for his client to return to her house or to work, Shapiro said. This week television crews and photographers hung around the employee entrance of the Sofitel and loitered outside her apartment, hoping for a glimpse of her. Shapiro said his client is now in a ""safe place,"" but would not elaborate. ""Her life has now been turned upside down,"" Shapiro said. ""She can't go home, she can't go back to work. ... This has been nothing short of a cataclysmic event in her life."" ___ Associated Press writers David B. Caruso and Tom Hays in New York, video producer Matt Friedman in Washington and Raphael G.

While the French, like Pakistan, are aghast at how the presumed wrongdoer was ‘detained’ – they both also assert disgust with the crimes they are – or were – charged with. To say that the French are shocked with the way Dominique Strauss-Kahn has been treated by the U.S. justice system would be an understatement. But Olivier Picard, columnist for France’s Les Dernières Nouvelles d’Alsace, writes that while U.S. justice may seem rough – the aloof behavior of France’s elite may have taken a blow. For Les Dernières Nouvelles d’Alsace, Olivier Picard writes in part: That night, DSK’s [Dominique Strauss-Kahn] hands cuffed behind his back, in the glare of flash photography – the scene irresistibly evokes that of Kennedy’s assassin Lee Harvey Oswald, flanked by two FBI agents shortly before his own assassination. The parallel is obviously not a flattering one, but it reveals a lot about the downfall of one of the planet’s most powerful men. The meteoric trajectory that has brought the director of the International Monetary Fund down to the ranks of a common criminal has forcefully collided with the global imagination. Who hasn’t feared, deep down in one’s soul, the cruelty of a fate that in 48 hours, destroys what it has taken a lifetime to build? Since yesterday evening, the man, who on Saturday morning was still the front-runner in the 2012 presidential election, has become a man like any other, at the mercy of proceedings he can no longer control. Justice must punish and put right; that is its raison d’etre. But for anonymous defendants and VIPs alike, after a court appearance and subsequent detention, there is no call for the added punishment of humiliation. Yesterday, the spectacle broadcast across the world was both fascinating – almost hypnotic – and deeply nauseating. There was something both primal and sacrificial in the self-satisfied exhibition of a person ravaged by his own history. And please don’t try explaining to us that the demands of the law are hardly compatible with respect for defendants! At the end of the day, the risk of catastrophe was knowingly taken. That catastrophe has now fully destroyed a contender for the presidency, and no one, it seems, had the courage to protect from himself. It should come as no surprise if his astonishing fall smashes along with it a little more of the country’s confidence in a political elite that lags behind the people.” READ ON AT WORLDMEETS.US , your most trusted translator and aggregator of foreign news and views about our nation."

Get the top business stories through the day on BlackBerry or iPhone by bookmarking our mobile-friendly webpage. Follow Michael Babad and the top business news on Twitter Bookie's odds on Carney A British bookmaker is giving to 10-to-1 odds on Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney succeeding Dominique Strauss-Kahn as chief of the International Monetary Fund. Mr. Carney ranks well down the list on the website of William Hill today, in betting that runs until tomorrow. Topping the list, at 6-to-4, is France's Finance Minister Christine Lagarde. Others on the list include Montek Singh Ahluwalia, a former IMF director (5-to-1), Singapore's Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam (8-to-1), Kemal Dervis, former Turkish finance minister (5-to-2), and Bundesbank chief Axel Weber (7-to-1). The longest shot is Bank of Mexico Governor Augstin Carstens, at 25-to-1. Not on the list is European Central Bank chief Jean-Claude Trichet. As The Globe and Mail's Kevin Carmichael reports today from Washington, Mr. Strauss-Kahn, who is charged in an alleged sexual assault and is in jail in New York, resigned. He has denied all allegations, and no charges have been proved in court. What that means is that if you wanted to bet on Mr. Carney, who adeptly guided Canada through the financial crisis and recession, $1 would bring you $10 plus the original bet of $1 if he's picked as the next chief. But that's not likely to happen. A European has held this post, and, as German Chancellor Angela Merkel said today, the Europeans want to keep it. “Naturally the developing countries have a claim on the highest position of the IMF or World Bank but the current situation speaks for a European candidate given the considerable problems of the euro,” Ms. Merkel told reporters in Berlin, according to Bloomberg News. Think about that for a minute. To date, the IMF, the European Union and the European Central Bank haven't been able to solve the continent's debt crisis, so maybe it's time for a Canadian to show them how to do it. ""Bank of Canada Governor Carney noted in a press conference earlier this week that the bank supports a merit-based approach to finding the next head of the IMF,"" said economists Derek Holt and Karen Woods of Scotia Capital.

IEA urges producers to act The International Energy Agency is pleading with energy producers to take action to head off a hit to the global recovery from high oil prices . ""Additional increases in prices at this stage of the economic cycle risk derailing the global economic recovery and are neither in the interest of producing nor of consuming countries,"" the Paris-based adviser said in a statement today after its board meeting. ""Oil importing developing countries are most likely to be seriously affected by high oil prices, undermining their economic and social well-being,"" it said in what was an unusual move for the group. ""In these circumstances, enhancing consumer-producer dialogue is urgently important to reach both short- and long-term solutions. The governing board urges action from producers that will help avoid the negative global economic consequences which a further sharp market tightening could cause, and welcomes commitments to increase supply."" The group said oil prices have declined by 10 per cent since May, but are still high, held aloft by market fundamentals, political uncertainty around the world, and simply future expectations. ""The IEA governing board expressed serious concern that there are growing signs that the rise in oil prices since September is affecting the economic recovery by widening global imbalances, reducing household and business income, and placing upward pressure on inflation and interest rates,"" it said. ""As global demand for oil increases seasonally from May to August, there is a clear, urgent need for additional supplies on a more competitive basis to be made available to refiners to prevent a further tightening of the market."" - IEA makes rare plea to oil producers Japan's economy shrinks Japan has plunged back into recession after the devastating earthquake and tsunami in mid-March did more damage to what had already been a faltering economy. The economy shrank by 0.9 per cent in the first quarter, or 3.7 per cent at an annual pace, according to official data released today, marking the second consecutive quarter of contraction to meet the technical definition of a recession. While the disaster in Japan came at the end of the quarter, it dealt a hefty blow. ""While a further contraction was expected as Japan faced a triple threat of earthquake, tsunami and nuclear problems in mid-March, Q1 GDP contracted at a much faster pace than expected, falling by 3.7 per cent quarter over quarter annualized (-0.9 per cent quarter over quarter) versus expectations of an annualized decline of 1.9 per cent (-0.5 per cent quarter over quarter),"" said Scotia Capital economists Karen Cordes Woods and Derek Holt. ""... While we are expecting to witness a rebound in Q3 as reconstruction begins, growth for the year as a whole will be quite modest."" - Disasters push Japan back into recession EI claims decline Claims for regular jobless benefits in Canada fell again in March, by 3 per cent, marking the sixth monthly decline in a row. Overall, initial and renewal claims were 226,600, Statistics Canada said today, down by 4.4 per cent or almost 10,500 from February. ""With this decrease, the number of claims received is the lowest since August 2008, just prior to the start of the labour market downturn,"" the federal agency said. It does not say why those claims have declined. Unemployment in Canada now stands at 7.6 per cent. In the United States, weekly jobless claims fell to 409,000, a better sign but still above the 400,000 mark. ""Jobless claims continued to descend from their recent spike, but at 409,000 in the latest week, are still at levels consistent with moderate job growth and little progress in bringing unemployment down,"" said Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC World Markets.

It also turned its partners, led by chief executive officer Ivan Glasenberg, into Europe’s newest billionaires or multimillionaires, Globe and Mail European correspondent Eric Reguly reports. Glencore sold 1.14 billion shares at £5.30 each (about $8.60 U.S.), raising about $10-billion and marking the biggest initial public offering so far this year.

87	Harper will try to take new clout to G8/G20	"But if his electoral success gives him new clout in Canada and added leeway in Parliament, at the upcoming summits he'll be just one of many world leaders struggling to find accord on everything from Middle East uprisings to policing the Internet and succouring newly vulnerable economies."	"A week of summits in France is Stephen Harper's first foreign foray as the head of a majority government. But if his electoral success gives him new clout in Canada and added leeway in Parliament, at the upcoming summits he'll be just one of many world leaders struggling to find accord on everything from Middle East uprisings to policing the Internet and succouring newly vulnerable economies. More related to this story - With IMF race heating up, a choice for Mr. Harper - Canada working on imposing sanctions on Syria - Time for Canada to reconnect with the world And at this particular summit, Canada has plenty of skin in the game: It's among several Group of Eight countries now at war in Libya; it has experienced first-hand the kind of cyber-attacks this week's Internet summit will try to tackle; and at a seminar on the social impacts of globalization, Canada will get the chance to tout its own recessionary recovery plan while brainstorming ways to tackle the systemic unemployment that's becoming an economic albatross. Then there's the elephant in the meeting room – the seat that should have been occupied by former IMF head Dominique Strauss-Kahn, now in the United States facing charges of attempted rape and sexual assault; and that of Christine Lagarde, the French Finance Minister behind whom Western support has coalesced to replace Mr. Strauss-Kahn even as other countries call for someone who better represents emerging economies. G20 globalization seminar What is it? A meeting of ministers from the G20 countries on the social impacts of globalization. When is it? Monday What's on the agenda? Jobs, jobs, jobs – how to create and keep high-quality employment, especially as jittery European countries face their own crises. “That sounds like a Sarko kind of topic,” says Queen's University Professor Robert Wolfe, referring to France's President Nicolas Sarkozy. “The French have always been worried about délocalisation.” But this isn't just Europe's problem. “For the first time, we have very severe, structural long-term unemployment in the United States,” says John Kirton, head of the University of Toronto's G8 research group. This imperative to tackle unemployment will likely drive countries to agree on a solution. Where does Canada come in? While Europe teeters on the brink of financial crisis and Japan slips back into recession, Canada's economy looks great by comparison. Mr. Harper and his representatives at the seminar will likely push to keep borders open while promoting their own economic strategies. E-G8 summit What is it? A meeting of G8 leaders and corporate representatives to tackle issues surrounding Internet security. When is it? Tuesday and Wednesday What's on the agenda? Everything from the Internet economy and the role of the online world in economic growth to “Internet and society,” social media and the challenge of policing the Net. What's angered many online advocates, however, is what isn't on the agenda. AccessNow, a group that advocates a freer Internet as a revolutionary tool, has castigated Mr. Sarkozy for not including more citizens' and civil-society groups. The people leading the meetings hail from Google, Facebook, France Telecom and eBay – not the populist bloggers behind online rebellions. “Access to the Internet for all should be the underlying principle,” says AccessNow executive director Brett Solomon. Where does Canada come in? Canada is no stranger to the importance of cyber-security: Ottawa was the target of hackers earlier this year, when tech-savvy miscreants compromised networks for the Finance Department, the Treasury Board and Defence Research and Development Canada. The Conservative government has also put forward legislation that would give police sweeping new powers of Internet surveillance. G8 summit What is it? An official summit meeting of all G8-country leaders. When is it? Thursday and Friday What's on the agenda? The Arab Spring – how to respond to it, how to assist citizen-led uprisings without dictating their outcome and what to do about the ongoing war in Libya – will be “the dominant issue of the Deauville summit,” Prof. Kirton said. “And it'll be the make-or-break issue.” There have been calls for further sanctions against Syria's Bashar al-Assad in the face of continuing violence against civilian protesters, as well as a version of the Marshall Plan – the post-Second World War recovery program for hard-hit European economies – for the Middle East. U.S. President Barack Obama hinted at some form of financial assistance in his speech on the topic last week. The summit will also attempt to tackle the ongoing crisis in Japan. Fallout from the March 11 earthquake and tsunami has rocked the global nuclear industry and pushed the country back into recession. There will be debates over both macroeconomic and physical assistance to Japan. Where does Canada come in? As one of the driving forces behind the ongoing conflict in Libya, Canada heads into these discussions with a lot on the table. It also has the chance to play a seminal role."

Lagarde had emerged as the frontrunner in the race to replace her countryman Dominique Strauss-Kahn as head of the International Monetary Fund, having won the support of European heavyweights France, Britain and Germany."	"PARIS - JUDGES may decide on June 10 whether or not to investigate Christine Lagarde, French finance minister and favourite to become the next head of the IMF, for abuse of power, legal sources said on Tuesday. This coincides with the closing date for the announcement of candidacies for the top international post. Lagarde has yet to say whether she will be in the running. Judicial officials said this was the date on which which the complaints commission of the Court of Justice of the Republic, which is charged with deciding whether serving ministers can be probed, will next meet. No decision on Lagarde's fate can be made before then. Lagarde had emerged as the frontrunner in the race to replace her countryman Dominique Strauss-Kahn as head of the International Monetary Fund, having won the support of European heavyweights France, Britain and Germany. But her candidacy is dogged by allegations she exceeded her authority by cutting short a legal battle between French tycoon Bernard Tapie and a formerly state-owned bank and sending the parties into binding arbitration. The arbitration panel decided to award Tapie, a supporter of Lagarde's boss President Nicolas Sarkozy, 385 million euros in the case, linked to the bank's alleged mishandling of the entrepreneur's sale of the Adidas sportswear firm. Prosecutors investigating complaints over Lagarde's role have asked the Court of Justice of the Republic to decided whether she can be formally investigated on charges of exceeding her authority. The court could give one of three decisions: It could throw out the case, it could ask for more information or it could order an inquiry which in turn could see Lagarde charged with a criminal offence. If convicted she could eventually face five years in prison. Few in France expect it to come to that but - after New York prosecutors charged Strauss-Kahn with the sexual assault and attempted rape of a hotel chamber maid - some IMF members might be wary of more scandal. -- AFP"

Spitzer interviewed the lawyer of the alleged victim in the DSK case. He also had an exclusive interview with Rick Welts -- the president and chief executive of the Phoenix Suns who recently announced he is gay -- and anchored a discussion on Eric Schneiderman, the New York attorney general currently investigating three Wall Street banks.

"The two people would not describe the material found on the shirt but said DNA matched a sample from Strauss-Kahn, who submitted to testing after his arrest more than a week ago. He denies the maid's allegations. Testing was being performed on other items, said the two people, who were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter and spoke to the AP on Monday on condition of anonymity. During their investigation, authorities cut out a piece of carpet and swabbed sinks and other surfaces in his hotel room. Investigators told the AP they believed the carpet in the hotel room may contain Strauss-Kahn's semen, spat out after an episode of forced oral sex by the maid. The forensic evidence is the first to link Strauss-Kahn to the woman - and it's also on track with what his lawyers have suggested would be his defense. Strauss-Kahn's attorney Benjamin Brafman declined to comment on Monday. At a court hearing last week, he told a judge that forensic evidence developed in the investigation ""will not be consistent with a forcible encounter"" - leading to speculation that Strauss-Kahn's defense would argue that it was consensual. New York Police Department spokesman Paul J. Browne and the Manhattan district attorney's office wouldn't comment. The one-time French presidential contender has been charged with a criminal sex act, attempted rape and sexual abuse and is free on $1 million bail, under house arrest at a lower Manhattan apartment. He's been accused of attacking the 32-year-old West African immigrant on May 14 in his luxury suite at the Sofitel hotel near Manhattan's Times Square. His lawyers say he's innocent. Staff at the Sofitel told authorities that the 62-year-old Strauss-Kahn had made passes at them the day before the attack was reported, including flirting with a clerk and calling another employee to ask her up to his room, according to a third person with direct knowledge of investigators' interviews with staff. Strauss-Kahn had flirted with one female staff member who accompanied him to his suite to make sure his accommodations were satisfactory after he checked in on May 13, the person said. Later, he phoned the desk clerk who had checked him in, asking her if she would like to get together with him when she got off duty, the person said. The desk clerk refused, saying she was not allowed to socialize with the VIP guest, the person said. That person also wasn't authorized to speak publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity. On Monday, lawyers for Strauss-Kahn continued to search for new housing for their client as he awaits trial. His bail agreement hit a snag late last week after tenants at the Upper East Side apartment building chosen for his house arrest refused to allow him, citing unwanted media attention. Strauss-Kahn has been staying at a temporary location under watch by armed guards with Stroz Friedberg, the same company that guarded disgraced financier Bernard Madoff. It wasn't clear when he would be moved. French and U.S. media have been staking out the building where Strauss-Kahn spent the weekend after he was released from his Rikers Island jail cell. He resigned last Wednesday from the IMF. His attorneys have described Strauss-Kahn as a loving father and family man. They say his actions after the attack was reported are not those of a guilty man eager for a quick escape. He left the hotel, had lunch and then phoned later to ask if he'd left anything behind. When hotel staff said he had left his cellphone, he told them exactly where he was: at John F. Kennedy International Airport on a flight bound for Paris. Authorities pulled him from the jetliner. --- Associated Press writer Tom Hays contributed to this report."

His arrest on charges including attempted rape shocked France and cast intense attention on his accuser, a 32-year-old chambermaid from the West African nation of Guinea. On Tuesday her lawyer, Jeffrey Shapiro, said he had no doubts his client was telling the truth about her encounter with Strauss-Kahn on Saturday. ""She came from a country in which poor people had little or no justice, and she's now in a country where the poor have the same rights as do the rich and the powerful,"" Shapiro said. ""What (Strauss-Kahn) might be able to get away with in some countries, he can't here in this country."" Strauss-Kahn's lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said at his client's arraignment this week that defense lawyers believe the forensic evidence ""will not be consistent with a forcible encounter."" But Shapiro dismissed suggestions that the woman had made up the charges or tried to cover up a consensual encounter. ""This is nothing other than a physical, sexual assault by this man on this young woman,"" Shapiro said in an interview in his Manhattan office. He said that the woman didn't know who was staying in the 28th-floor suite she went to clean on Saturday afternoon, before she said she was attacked. ""She did not know who this man was until a day or two after this took place,"" Shapiro said. ""She had no idea who this man was."" Strauss-Kahn is also charged with sex abuse, a criminal sex act, unlawful imprisonment and forcible touching. The most serious charge carries five to 25 years in prison. Because of his high profile, he was being held Tuesday at Rikers Island in a section of the jail that normally houses prisoners with highly contagious diseases like measles or tuberculosis. Corrections spokesman Stephen Morello said Strauss-Kahn has been placed in a wing with about 14 cells, all of them empty except for his. Norman Seabrook, president of the correction officers union, said Strauss-Kahn did or said something during a mental health evaluation that concerned doctors, and he is being monitored day and night. A law enforcement official, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of prisoner medical information, said Strauss-Kahn had not tried to harm himself.

"VIENNA (Reuters) - Austrian Finance Minister Maria Fekter backed French counterpart Christine Lagarde for the top job at the International Monetary Fund and threw her weight behind Austrian banks in the debate over new capital rules. ""There is great interest in this tradition that a European leads the IMF and the Europeans are fighting for this now,"" Fekter told Austrian radio an interview aired on Saturday. She called Lagarde ""a very competent person. I know her and I could well imagine that Austria would join in here."" The IMF need a new head after Dominique Strauss-Kahn resigned to devote his time and energy to defending himself against U.S. charges he tried to rape a chambermaid. Wading into a national debate about whether politicians were doing enough to defend the country's economic interests, Fekter said she would lobby the European Union to ensure new capital rules for banks did not put Austrian lenders at a disadvantage. Erste Group Bank Chief Executive Andreas Treichl launched the debate by calling politicians ""too stupid and cowardly"" to fight proposed Basel III capital rules, a comment for which he has since apologized. He still argues the rules may trigger a credit crunch by making banks back loans to healthy companies with 10 times as much capital as for debt of struggling countries like Greece. ""It is positive that we have a broad discussion over Basel III and that it is widely recognized that under some circumstances a negative effect for small Austrian borrowers could emerge,"" Fekter said when asked about the dispute. ""I think it is a legitimate approach to differentiate between (rules covering) investment banks and commercial banks and we will make efforts in Brussels to get exactly this differentiating treatment into the rules,"" she said. Her comments come amid a potential EU rift over how to implement bank capital rules. Treichl said this week that Erste had asked to pay back by the end of next month 1.2 billion euros ($1.72 billion) in state capital it got at the height of the financial crisis, but Fekter said regulatory approvals still needed to be sorted out. ""To make a repayment the bank needs to show national bank supervisors and the National Bank that its capital coverage is sufficient,"" she said. ""We don't have yet an official repayment application because first the procedure has to be settled with the National Bank before they can apply."" Asked if that would mean Erste could then repay the money, she said: ""At any time.""

97	Risk in Europe's rush for IMF job	"FT.com European policymakers scrambled on Thursday to stake the continent's claim to provide the next leader of the International Monetary Fund, after the resignation of Dominique Strauss-Kahn as managing director.
Angela Merkel, German chancellor, said: ""Naturally the developing countries have a claim on the highest position of the IMF or World Bank but the current situation speaks for a European candidate given the considerable problems of the euro."	"FT.com European policymakers scrambled on Thursday to stake the continent's claim to provide the next leader of the International Monetary Fund, after the resignation of Dominique Strauss-Kahn as managing director. Strauss-Kahn's departure, announced late on Wednesday Washington time, followed increasing pressure from the US and other governments for him to step down after he was charged with sexual assault on a hotel maid in New York last weekend. The former IMF managing director was set to leave police custody on Thursday after he was granted bail, but he was also indicted for trial and will be kept under 24 hour armed guard at a home while he awaits it. Strauss-Kahn appeared in the courtroom in a grey suit and blue shirt. As he walked in, he gave his lawyers, who were seated, a weary nod. He smiled at his wife and daughter in the court, and blew them a kiss on his way out. He has been held at Riker's Island jail since Monday. The IMF's executive board, on which European countries hold just over 30 per cent of the votes, will probably appoint the next managing director within the next month or two, with candidates nominated by member countries. The US holds 17 per cent. Officials from Europe, which has provided every managing director since the IMF started to operate in 1946, said that the difficulties in western European economies argued for the tradition to be continued. Angela Merkel, German chancellor, said: ""Naturally the developing countries have a claim on the highest position of the IMF or World Bank but the current situation speaks for a European candidate given the considerable problems of the euro."" Olli Rehn, the European Union's top economic official, said the appointment should be ""merit-based"", adding; ""in this current juncture it is a merit if the person has quite solid knowledge of the European economy and decision making"". Christine Lagarde, French finance minister, is the name most widely touted in European circles. ""The EU, whose member states are the biggest shareholder in the Fund, can propose a candidacy of very high quality,"" said Nicolas Sarkozy, French president, in an apparent reference to Lagarde. ""Europe must unite"". A Lagarde candidacy, however, could be overshadowed by a judicial investigation into her appointment of an arbitration panel to settle a long-running dispute between Bernard Tapie, a French businessman, and the French government. Herman Van Rompuy, the EU's president, urged a quick decision. ""We are feeling a lack of leadership in solving the Greek crisis."" The US is likely to play a key role. Tim Geithner, US Treasury secretary, on Thursday released a short statement expressing confidence in John Lipsky, the IMF's second-in-command who has automatically become acting managing director, and calling for ""an open process that leads to a prompt succession"" to appoint a new head. Emerging market governments including China and Brazil said they wanted a fair and open process. Finance officials say the most likely non-European nominee is Kemal Dervis, a former Turkish economy minister. Additional reporting Quentin Peel in Berlin.

99	EU Rehn: Greece Must Take Steps In Coming Days; Debt 'Reprofile' Option	#NAME?	"(Adds comments, including on Strauss-Kahn in new final two paragraphs) BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- Greece has promised to announce new efforts in the coming days to tackle its economic crisis, the European commissioner for economic affairs said Tuesday. Commissioner Olli Rehn said the measures are ""indispensable"" before euro zone countries can consider further steps to help the debt-strapped country avoid default. In particular, Greece must immediately carry through on its plans to raise EUR50 billion by selling state assets, including EUR15 billion this year, he said after talks with European finance ministers. Rehn said a restructuring of Greek debt is not an option. However, a ""reprofiling,"" or voluntarily extension of loan maturities held by private investors, could be examined, he said. ""The Greek government has committed to taking further measures of fiscal consolidation in the coming days"" to meet its budget deficit targets for 2011 and future years, Rehn said. He said the measures must have must have broad political support. ""If it is possible for Portugal and Ireland, how come not in Greece?"" said Rehn. Political parties in Ireland and Portugal had to swallow some of their differences in return for bailouts from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. Greece continues to struggle under its heavy debt load a year after it secured its own EUR110 billion rescue package on promises to meet tough fiscal targets. The EU and IMF are now reviewing the country's efforts. Rehn said he trusts that Athens will receive its next loan disbursement after the review. Rehn also answered questions on the potential need to fill the position of the IMF managing director after the arrest of the current chief, Dominique Strauss-Kahn. ""Europeans have a strong interest in this post,"" he said, adding that the IMF is playing a key role in addressing the sovereign debt crisis. -By Riva Froymovich and William Horobin, Dow Jones Newswires; riva.froymovich@dowjones.com - print this - rss feed - email alerts More Like This... - Reuters launches Dealing Aggregator Thomson Reuters has launched a new FX aggregation service, available exclusively to users of the Thomson Reuters Dealing service on a proprietary or hosted basis.

100	IMF Chief May Have Been Riding Dirty! (PHOTOS)	"As if the sex scandal involving IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn couldn't get any crazier, it was reported today that his alleged sexual assault victim lives in an apartment in the Bronx which only rents to individuals living with HIV or AIDS.
The New York Post reported that the West African hotel maid who was allegedly assaulted by Strauss-Kahn lived in one such household with her 15-year old daughter."	"As if the sex scandal involving IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn couldn't get any crazier, it was reported today that his alleged sexual assault victim lives in an apartment in the Bronx which only rents to individuals living with HIV or AIDS. Put two and two together and the future looks even bleaker for Strauss-Kahn, who's on suicide watch at Rikers Island after being charged with attempted rape of a 32-year-old Manhattan hotel maid. Harlem Community AIDS United, a non-profit organization, provides housing exclusively to people living with AIDS or HIV and their families. The New York Post reported that the West African hotel maid who was allegedly assaulted by Strauss-Kahn lived in one such household with her 15-year old daughter. In order to qualify for an apartment, at least one adult living there must be HIV-positive or have AIDS. Since the alleged victim's daughter is a minor, there is speculation that the victim likely has HIV or AIDS."
101	Europe says next IMF chief must come from EU	"Europe says next IMF chief must come from EU DON MELVIN and BRADLEY KLAPPER - The Globe and Mail The European Commission insisted Thursday that next leader of the International Monetary Fund must come from the 27-nation European Union, a stance backed by the Germany, the continent's economic heavyweight.
Other potential European candidates include Germany's former central bank chief, Axel Weber; the head of Europe's bailout fund, Klaus Regling; and Peer Steinbrueck, a former German finance minister."	"Europe says next IMF chief must come from EU DON MELVIN and BRADLEY KLAPPER - The Globe and Mail The European Commission insisted Thursday that next leader of the International Monetary Fund must come from the 27-nation European Union, a stance backed by the Germany, the continent's economic heavyweight. Frenchman Dominique Strauss-Kahn resigned as IMF chief Wednesday, saying he wants to devote “all his energy” to fighting sexual assault charges in New York. The move heated up cross-border debate over his successor, with Europe aggressively staking its traditional claim to the job to ensure that Europe's debt crisis is given priority. Fast-growing nations such as China, Brazil and South Africa are trying to break Europe's grip on an organization empowered to direct billions of dollars to stabilize the global economy. EU Commission spokeswoman Pia Ahrenkilde Hansen said the EU wants continuity at the helm of the IMF and said its members can “identify strong candidates in the midst of the European Union.” In Berlin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel pushed for a quick decision on a successor to Strauss-Kahn and underlined her hopes that a European will get the job. “It is of great significance, of course, that we find a quick solution,” she said Thursday, without naming specific candidates. The IMF's executive board released a letter from Mr. Strauss-Kahn on Wednesday in which he denied the allegations lodged against him but said with “sadness” he felt he must resign, to protect his family and the IMF. “It is with infinite sadness that I feel compelled today to present to the executive board my resignation from my post of managing director of the IMF,” the five-paragraph letter said. “I think at this time first of my wife — whom I love more than anything — of my children, of my family, of my friends. I think also of my colleagues at the Fund. Together we have accomplished such great things over the last three years and more. “I deny with the greatest possible firmness all of the allegations that have been made against me. I want to protect this institution which I have served with honor and devotion, and especially — especially — I want to devote all my strength, all my time and all my energy to proving my innocence.” Mr. Strauss-Kahn is facing a bail hearing Thursday in New York that could have spelled the end of his leadership of the IMF anyway. He faces charges of assaulting a maid in a New York hotel room and has been jailed in New York since Monday. The maid, a 32-year-old immigrant from the West African nation of Guinea, told police that the 62-year-old Strauss-Kahn came out of the bathroom naked, chased her down, forced her to perform oral sex on him and tried to remove her underwear before she broke free and fled. The IMF's statement late Wednesday said the process of choosing a new leader would begin, but in the meantime John Lipsky would remain its acting managing director. Europeans have led the IMF since its inception after World War II. Americans have occupied both the No. 2 position at the IMF and the top post at its sister institution, the World Bank. The World Bank funds projects in developing countries. France's Finance Minister Christine Lagarde emerged as a potential candidate. A sharp, articulate negotiator with impeccable English who lived for many years in the United States, Ms. Lagarde has a strong international reputation. “I am convinced that she is a good candidate. I made a few trips with her to Asia. I was able to verify her popularity among ministers of large emerging countries,” France's transport minister, Thierry Mariani, told France-Info radio Thursday. While Ms. Lagarde's name has surfaced in other capitals, Mr. Mariani was the first member of the French government to speak about it publicly. However, Ms. Lagarde is a member of French President Nicolas Sarkozy's conservative UMP party, and if Mr. Sarkozy openly pushes for her candidacy, that could feed widespread belief in France that the accusations against Mr. Strauss-Kahn were part of a conspiracy to knock him off his path toward the French presidency. “There is no time to waste, because we have a lot of issues to deal with,” French Foreign Ministry spokesman Bernard Valero told The Associated Press on Thursday. Developing nations see Europe's stranglehold on the position as increasingly out of touch with the world economy. China's is now the world's second largest economy. India's and Brazil's have cracked the top 10. Many emerging economies are sitting on stockpiles of cash and have become forces of financial stability, while rich countries have become weighed down by debt. “We must establish meritocracy, so that the person leading the IMF is selected for their merits and not for being European,” Brazilian Finance Minister Guido Mantega said, calling for a “new criteria” for leadership. “You can have a competent European ... but you can have a representative from an emerging nation who is competent as well.” China suggested it was time to shake things up at the IMF, with Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu saying the leadership “should be based on fairness, transparency and merit.” The United States has a major say in determining who will head the fund, in part because it holds the largest number of votes. The prevailing view among analysts and former Treasury officials appears to be that Washington would back a strong European candidate who could be approved in a smooth process. Other potential European candidates include Germany's former central bank chief, Axel Weber; the head of Europe's bailout fund, Klaus Regling; and Peer Steinbrueck, a former German finance minister. Candidates from elsewhere include Turkey's former finance minister, Kemal Dervis; Singapore's finance chief, Tharman Shanmugaratnam; and Indian economist Montek Singh Ahluwalia. ——— Klapper reported from Washington.

"WASHINGTON: As the International Monetary Fund prepares to replace its disgraced former chief, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, women employees have called for a female boss at the helm of the financial institution, a media report said. 'CNN' claims to have obtained e-mails which suggest the female staff have for long been complaining about the male culture at the IMF and they now want a woman to run the global economic organisation. In fact, in the e-mails exchanged among numerous female workers at the IMF late last week in response to a 'New York Times' article titled, 'At IMF, Men on Prowl and Women on Guard', women are bemoaning a ""male dominated workplace"" where ""gender stats speak for themselves"". One female worker in her e-mail asks whether the IMF would be better off with a woman in charge ""to end such a negative impression"". She tells colleagues: ""We now have a good opportunity to voice it out."" Another e-mail reads: ""Would be naive to pretend that there is no glass ceiling."" Responding to the leaked e-mails, IMF spokesman Bill Murray told 'CNN' that the fund ""isn't satisfied with the level of diversity at senior management level and is working to improve this."" The IMF is to begin accepting nominations for the replacement of 62-year-old Strauss-Kahn who resigned last week in the wake of allegations that he tried to rape a chambermaid in his suite at a New York hotel on May 14. He was arrested by the police, but he is now out on bail. He denies the charges. Britain said over the weekend it would back French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde for the position. The fund said Friday that it aims to complete the selection process by June 30.

104	AP sources: DNA matches Strauss-Kahn in sex attack	"The people say DNA found on the maid's shirt match to a sample of Dominique Strauss-Kahn's DNA.
Curious onlookers and a throng of reporters desperate for a glimpse into Dominique Strauss-Kahn's life under house arrest were rewarded with a sighting of the former IMF leader's wife leaving their luxury high-rise.
The 62-year-old Strauss-Kahn, once a French presidential contender, remains ensconced in the granite skyscraper as cameras and armed guards keep watch."	"NEW YORK New tests have found that the DNA of the former International Monetary Fund leader matches material found on the shirt of a hotel maid who says he attacked her. Two people familiar with the investigation tell The Associated Press that the tests were returned Monday afternoon. The people weren't authorized to speak publicly about the matter and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity. The people say DNA found on the maid's shirt match to a sample of Dominique Strauss-Kahn's DNA. Strauss-Kahn attorney Benjamin Brafman declined to comment Monday. At a court hearing last week, Brafman told a judge that evidence from the incident won't be consistent with a forcible encounter. Strauss-Kahn faces charges including attempted rape and sexual abuse in the May 14 incident at New York's Sofitel Hotel. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP's earlier story is below. Curious onlookers and a throng of reporters desperate for a glimpse into Dominique Strauss-Kahn's life under house arrest were rewarded with a sighting of the former IMF leader's wife leaving their luxury high-rise. Anne Sinclair, a prominent French TV journalist before her marriage to Strauss-Kahn, left the couple's temporary apartment in lower Manhattan late Sunday morning and stepped into a waiting SUV. She returned four hours later, her activities a mystery. The 62-year-old Strauss-Kahn, once a French presidential contender, remains ensconced in the granite skyscraper as cameras and armed guards keep watch. Outside, open-top buses slow down as tourists snap photos of Strauss-Kahn's temporary home. Since Strauss-Kahn was moved there Friday from his Rikers Island jail cell, a crowd of international reporters has been gathered around the clock. The cost to secure him has been estimated at $200,000 a month. The funds, which he must cover, will go toward armed surveillance, the installation of cameras and a special bracelet shackled to his ankle that will set off an alarm if he travels too far. Right now, he's not allowed out of the building at all, but after he's moved to a more permanent location, he can leave for court, doctor visits and weekly religious services. Prosecutors must be notified at least six hours before he goes anywhere. He can't be out between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. It's not clear when Strauss-Kahn will be moved, though prosecutors have said the security company advised that Broadway apartment would be available for only three or four days. He is accused of attacking a 32-year-old housekeeper on May 14 in his $3,000-a-night hotel suite in midtown Manhattan. The West African immigrant told police he chased her down a hallway in the suite, forced her to perform oral sex and tried to remove her stockings. He is scheduled for arraignment on June 6. Another Manhattan building rejected him after residents expressed fears about the kind of 24-hour media frenzy being staged on Broadway behind police barricades. Sinclair, who is wealthy in her own right, has stood by her husband since his arrest, helping secure the $5 million bond the judge added to the bail agreement. Strauss-Kahn resigned Wednesday as managing director of the International Monetary Fund, an organization that provides billions in loans to stabilize the world economy. France's finance minister, Christine Lagarde, has emerged as a front-runner to replace Strauss-Kahn, but emerging economies have pressed for an end to Europe's traditional stranglehold on the position of IMF managing director. The IMF has been accepting nominations from member countries for candidates to succeed Strauss-Kahn. Its executive board said it plans to make its selection by the end of June."

"Ex-IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn swapped one of America’s toughest jails for the bright lights of Broadway on Friday night. The former French finance minister left Rikers Island for a luxury appartment in downtown Manhattan, New York City. Strauss-Kahn spent four nights in the notorious prison. He has now been formally charged with sexually assaulting and attempting to rape a hotel chambermaid. A judge granted him bail that he agreed to wear an electronic tag and posted a 700,000 euro bond. Strauss has also surrendered all travel documents and will be monitored around the clock by an armed guard. He next appears in court on June 6. His lawyers say the 62-year-old will plead not guilty to all the charges.

"* Strauss-Kahn's accuser hails from remote African village * Brother speaks of devout Muslim childhood amid poverty By Saliou Samb LABE REGION, Guinea, May 24 (Reuters) - In a living room bare but for a few family photos and Islamic texts, the African man who says he is the brother of Dominique Strauss-Kahn's accuser says he has not slept or eaten properly for days. ""I heard the news on the radio and honestly I do not know what happened. I want to speak to my sister,"" the man, called Mamoudou, told Reuters at a village in the Labe region of Guinea, a hard day's drive north of the capital Conakry. Mamoudou, whose family name and home village are withheld to protect the identity of the alleged assault victim, said he had not heard from his younger sister for several years. But he had no doubt that she was the 32-year-old Guinean widow who filed the complaint in New York. Her name has appeared in local media. In the community of devout Muslims, religion provides solace for those with troubles far away, and for poverty at home. A hamlet of 20 dwellings lost in the rural depths of this impoverished West African country, Mamoudou's village is a world away from the luxury suite of the Times Square Sofitel where the now former chief of the International Monetary Fund and French presidential contender is accused of trying to rape the maid.

"Strauss-Kahn released from jail PTI | 12:05 PM,May 21,2011 From Betwa Sharma New York, May 21 (PTI) Former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who has been indicted on all seven counts of sexual assault charges, was released from the jail today, a day after being granted a USD 1 million cash bail.After he left Rikers Island jail here, Strauss-Kahn, 62, was taken to a building with rental apartments in Lower Manhattan where he will live temporarily with his wife Anne Sinclair, a television journalist.Strauss-Kahn, who was widely expected to run in the 2012 presidential race in France, will have to wear an electronic monitoring device.He will be allowed to leave the house only on medical emergency.The US media reported that Sinclair had tried to rent an apartment at the posh Bristol Plaza but was turned down once it was discovered that Strauss-Kahn would be living there.""It doesn't seem quite right for him to be put here with the rest of us, enjoy our hospitality, after what he's been accused of doing,"" said Sandra Pohutsky, of San Francisco, who was staying in the Bristol with a friend, The New York Times reported.""The discrepancy between Rikers and here is probably very great, and it doesn't seem quite right,"" she said.""I think it's an inconvenience for all of us,"" a resident, Michele Smith, said.Strauss-Kahn was granted a USD I million bail yesterday after he was formally indicted on all seven counts of sexually assaulting a chambermaid at Sofitel hotel in Manhattan.The former IMF chief was also asked to pay an additional bond of USD 5 million. He will also shell out 200,000 for armed guards.Strauss-Kahn, who has claimed innocence, was locked up in a New York prison since last week, when he was bundled out of a Paris-bound flight and taken into custody on charges of sexually assaulting the maid.Strauss-Kahn has been charged with a criminal sex act, attempted rape and unlawful imprisonment.He allegedly forced the maid, who is a native of Guinea, to perform oral sex and submit to anal sex.Meanwhile, yesterday, a law enforcement official reportedly said at least two other Sofitel employees told investigators that Strauss-Kahn made advances toward them during his stay. « Previous Next » This is an automated news feed.

"LOS ANGELES, May 17, 2011 — With the recent events revolving around Strauss-Kahn and his alleged behavior at the Sofitel New York, we have yet another politician with an overblown sense of entitlement to balance an apparent lack of common sense. (Strauss-Kahn consulting not with world leaders, but with his attorney Benjamin Brafman, in Manhattan Criminal Court in New York (Image: Associated Press)) Strauss-Kahn consulting not with world leaders, but with his attorney Benjamin Brafman, in Manhattan Criminal Court in New York (Image: Associated Press) Due to his party affiliations we can assume that DSK, as he is affectionately known is a person with a liberal based compassion for the weaker members of society; Stature that was seriously damaged by allegedly sexually assaulting a French hotel worker at the New York Sofitel hotel where he spent his time lounging naked in his $3,000 dollar a night suite. Even if proven to be ""consensual,"" which the women's attorney denies, it just makes no sense that a man of his stature would put themselves in such a morally questionable position of casual, sex with an employee during business hours. How does that help the ""workers"" of the world? Dominique Strauss-Kahn is more than just the head of the International Monetary Fund. He is also a member of France’s Socialist Party; Strauss-Kahn and was expected to run, and quite possibly win, the presidency of France. Innocent until proven guilty, something we should not forget just as DSK should have not forgotten his cell phone when he fled the hotel after the attack. When he was found, he was on a plane to France. We should also not forget that the Sofitel employee, a 32-year old immigrant from Guinea, picked DSK out of a lineup not having any idea of his international celebrity status. She would not have intentionally targeted him as a possible boyfriend. She had no idea who he was at the time of the attack. But then most Americans have no idea who this guy is and would have failed to identify him on a Late Night With Jimmy Fallon ""Name That Guy"" segment. DSK is now enjoying the hospitality of penal system at Riker’s Island while he awaits possible Grand Jury indictment. HuffPo blogger Jayne Lyn Stahl takes the position that ""the French government should insist Strauss-Khan be extradited to France to face charges"" of alleged attempted rape, sodomy, and false imprisonment. Leave it to the leftist HuffPot to allege that the U.S. is no longer fit to charge and try French nationals for violent sexual attacks on U.S. soil, even if the system is adequate to try those accused of terrorism. (Inmate housing on New York's Rikers Island penal complex where Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the chief of the International Monetary Fund, spent Monday night, May 16, 2011 (Image: Associated Press)) Inmate housing on New York's Rikers Island penal complex where Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the chief of the International Monetary Fund, spent Monday night, May 16, 2011 (Image: Associated Press) If I was DSK I would take my chances and claim that the cavity search at Rikers Island was meant to elicit a false confession, the same defense alleged terrorist Ahmed Ghailani, charged with the African Embassy bombings, successfully used. There is point that being a leftist is too often used to exploit people in the name of compassion. Have we forgotten Bill Clinton and Ted Kennedy? Where else could he get a fairer trial than a country that was able to turn a blind eye to the early exploits of Ted Kennedy? Here is the opening statement that any good leftist defense attorney could prepare: ""My client did not sexually assault that hotel worker. This is a right-wing smear campaign brought about by Neocons like Sarkozy and Bush, with help from the Zionists."" As for why he was naked when the woman entered his room, according to his lawyer, Mr. Brafman, was rushing to leave the Sofitel to have lunch. Presumably he was lunching in France, as this is where he was heading when detained. It also makes us wonder if one frequently lunches nude while in France. [If he was in fact nude and in a hurry to leave when the woman came into the room, it does seem to raise the question…] Jeff Shapiro, the woman's attorney, has denied that the encounter was consensual. As our Federal prosecutors are taught not to levy charges without credible evidence, we can assume that police and medical reports are consistent with a sexual attack. Additionally, reports are that blood discovered in the room, as well as the examination of the woman, corroborate her account of the attack. DSK can also play the ""poor me"" card in that he has suffered enough abuse. He is French. He is a man named Dominique, which not only forced the newspapers to give him initials instead of a name, but most likely led to him getting beaten up many times over the years by people thinking he is gay. Under the slightest chance that twelve liberals in either Manhattan or Paris would convict this man who splendidly represents their values, the punishment needs to fit the crime. Jail is not the answer. Dominique Strauss-Kahn is now perfectly qualified to be the Secretary General of the United Nations. He has executive experience at an organization that consistently fails to do the right thing. His European bailouts are the epitome of making excuses for bad decisions. Who better to make sure Syria and Libya finally get to run wild without impunity? Does the man hate America and Israel? It is very important that he does for this job. He is a French socialist, so let's give him the benefit of the doubt and assume he does. United Nations peacekeepers are great at raping innocent third world women they are supposed to be protecting. Who better to run the U.N. than an expert in abusing innocent women? (Dominique Strauss-Kahn, head of the International Monetary Fund, is lead from a police station in New York where he was being held.

(Image: Associated Press) Who better to pretend to care about the powerful than a man representing an ideology that allows powerful billionaires to spread misery to the masses in the name of compassion? So let's not get bogged down with distractions such as right and wrong, treating women as people, and obeying the rule of law. What is more important is that the ends justify the means. The man is European, and they are so refined and sophisticated. We need men like him to stand up to American slobs who eat hot dogs and prefer sports to the opera. It is high time we stop harassing leftist plutocrats for acting like themselves. DSK is not just a socialist. He is not just French. He is both of them. What do you expect? Stay classy, France. Stay compassionate, liberals. Keep up that sophisticated, caring stuff you do so well between centuries of indifference.

What has happened in New York with the IMF chief, supposedly is the exception to this rule: a sex scandal involving a French politician - except of course, in this case it is not just sex - it is also crime.
Therefore it would be impossible to conceive of a French sex scandal, because no-one would find it shocking if prominent people were engaged in extra-marital affairs."	"The Dominique Strauss-Kahn affair has brought back to mind that most hoary of cliches, that it is the British who have the sex scandals, while for the French the problem is money. What has happened in New York with the IMF chief, supposedly is the exception to this rule: a sex scandal involving a French politician - except of course, in this case it is not just sex - it is also crime. I have always thought the British-French dichotomy to be hokum of the highest order. The basis of the idea is that while the British are prudish and repressed about sex, the French are triumphantly open about it. Therefore it would be impossible to conceive of a French sex scandal, because no-one would find it shocking if prominent people were engaged in extra-marital affairs. It would just be perfectly normal behaviour. But I think this view of the French is wrong. 'Pernicious lie' It is the same lazy stereotyping that perpetuates the notion that the French are extraordinary lovers. They have no hang-ups about sex, so they cut to the chase and perform the act with all the fiery passion of their frenetic Gallic genes. The difference between the cultures is not sex, it is politics and power. Of course it suits everyone to keep this nonsense going. British newspapers and foreigners in general thrive on cliches about the French, so they happily churn out the pathetic surveys about how more condoms are used per male in France than in any other nation, or how Paris hotels are block-booked by middle-aged civil servants taking two hours off in the afternoon to cheat on their wives. And if you are French - well, if the rest of the world persists in thinking you are amazing lovers, can you blame them for going along with the lie? But it is all a lie, and a pernicious lie at that - as, I think, the latest events have shown. The difference between the cultures is not sex, it is politics and power. (Former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn inside of a New York State Supreme Courthouse during a bail hearing in New York May 19, 2011. ) Mr Strauss-Kahn was granted bail in New York on Thursday Let us imagine a powerful, charismatic former minister, the lode-star of his party, an intellect, a wit - but a man also with a passionate interest in sex. Let us imagine that in the course of his career, he becomes known as someone who uses both his political position and his physical strength to get women into bed. His friends warn him that his behaviour amounts to harassment, not to say abuse, but he keeps going. 'In-crowd' What happens in one society is that the man is exposed by the press. Intrusive, tabloid, exploitative they may be - but newspapers find out the secrets, report them, and the man is forced to change or quit. But what happens in France? In France, the politician's aggressive sexual antics are ignored by the press. Privacy laws stop them publishing, but in any case journalists and politicians inhabit the same metropolitan in-crowd - and ""well, it's just old so-and-so; we all know how he's the 'great seducer'.. ha-ha; and no-one's ever complained, have they?"" Those in the know, know. But they don't say. And so old so-and-so begins to think he can get away with anything… anywhere. In France - this revolutionary Eden - all life, political and cultural, revolves around elites. These people are spared serious intrusion into their lives - so some of them do end up acting like some ""fin de siecle"" flaneur in a Guy de Maupassant short story, collecting mistresses and perpetuating the myth about the great Gallic lover. But I can assure you most people do not live that kind of life.

111	“Saturday Night Live” Opens With A Rape Joke	"Even though the opening skit of this weekend’s “Saturday Night Live ” starred the only two black men in the cast as inmates at Rikers Island meeting accused sexual predator Dominique Strauss-Kahn (played by Taran Killiam), I was willing to go with it.
Anyway, the skit was pretty funny: Keenan Thompson and Jay Pharoah played two guys locked in a cell bickering about the International Monetary Fund."	"I have a sense of humor. I swear to God, I do. But, damn it, rape jokes are never funny. Even though the opening skit of this weekend’s “Saturday Night Live ” starred the only two black men in the cast as inmates at Rikers Island meeting accused sexual predator Dominique Strauss-Kahn (played by Taran Killiam), I was willing to go with it. Slightly racist casting there, but who knows, maybe they were the two cast members most enthusiastic about the material? Anyway, the skit was pretty funny: Keenan Thompson and Jay Pharoah played two guys locked in a cell bickering about the International Monetary Fund. I giggled a little, because it was silly. And then, at the end of the skit, Keenan says, “We’re going to rape you now.” Oh, God, do I even have to say rape isn’t funny? Do I even have to say prison rape isn’t funny? So, a hotel maid being sexually assaulted is an evil act, but being sexually assaulted in prison is hilarious street justice? Rape is not funny or deserved, or will ever be funny or deserved, in any context. C’mon, “Saturday Night Live.” You know better. [NBC ]"
112	IMF boss moved to prison	"IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn will spend the next few nights in Rikers Island jail, a notorious New York holding facility for those awaiting trial.
'He will be in a single person cell and kept away from other inmates,' a New York City Department of Corrections spokesman said.
' The New York jail is a chaotic maze of holding cells filled with thousands of defendants who either can't afford bail or who, like Strauss-Kahn, are deemed a flight risk and have had their bail application denied."	"IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn will spend the next few nights in Rikers Island jail, a notorious New York holding facility for those awaiting trial. 'He will be in a single person cell and kept away from other inmates,' a New York City Department of Corrections spokesman said. 'He goes to Rikers to sleep tonight. He might already be there.' The New York jail is a chaotic maze of holding cells filled with thousands of defendants who either can't afford bail or who, like Strauss-Kahn, are deemed a flight risk and have had their bail application denied. The complex, which sits on a 1650 kilometres island on the East River near LaGuardia airport between Queens and the Bronx, can house more than 20,000 detainees and staff at a time. The Department of Corrections spokesman said Strauss-Kahn would not have to remain in his cell at all times, but anytime that he was outside his cell, 'he would be accompanied by correction officers'. Rikers Island is the city's main detention facility and includes 10 separate jails where prisoners are segregated by gender and age. There are no prisons for long-term detainees in New York and most of the city's 13,000 jail inmates - awaiting trial or serving short sentences - are at Rikers, according to the Department of Corrections' website. Strauss-Kahn, who was arrested on sexual assault charges on Saturday, was denied bail at a packed hearing in a Manhattan courtroom on Monday. The one-time expected French presidential candidate, wearing a black raincoat and accompanied by a team of lawyers, looked haggard and stunned by the rapid developments. His lawyers have denied all charges. The alleged assault in a posh suite at New York's Sofitel hotel took place about 1pm local time on Saturday. Less than four hours later, Strauss-Kahn was whisked off the first class section of an Air France jet by police."

Bernard-Henri Lévy, the French philosopher and author, has defended his longtime friend Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former managing director of the IMF who was arrested last week on sexual assault charges. In a column at the Daily Beast, Lévy, a celebrity who has been derided by some as a ""playboy philosopher,"" wrote, ""I resent the New York tabloid press, a disgrace to the profession, that, without the least precaution and before having effected the least verification, has depicted Dominique Strauss-Kahn as a sicko, a pervert, borderlining on serial killer, a psychiatrist's dream."" Charles Simic, the poet, has written a powerful piece on the importance of public libraries. ""I don't know of anything more disheartening than the sight of a shut down library,"" he writes in the blog post at the New York Review of Books ( www.nybooks.com ).

"Business Editors: Among the stories for Tuesday from The Associated Press: TOP STORIES: ECONOMY WASHINGTON For homebuilders, it hardly feels like an economic recovery. Nearly two years after the recession ended, the pace of construction is inching along at less than half the level considered healthy. Single-family home building, the bulk of the market, has dropped 18 percent since the recession ended. Builders are competing with waves of foreclosures that have forced down prices for previously occupied homes. The weakness is weighing on the economy: Though new homes represent a small portion of overall sales, they have an outsized effect on jobs. By Economics Writer Derek Kravitz. LINKEDIN-IPO NEW YORK LinkedIn is boosting the price it's asking for shares of its initial public offering by 30 percent. That suggests investors are eager to buy stock of the professional networking website and bodes well for future IPOs of other social networking companies such as Facebook, Twitter and Groupon. The new price means LinkedIn could be valued at more than $4 billion after going public, making it the biggest Internet IPO since Google's debut in 2004.

Pictures of the great man in cuffs are indicative of “a brutality, a violence, of an incredible cruelty,” declared Elisabeth Guigou, a former French justice minister."	"French morals, American justice Margaret Wente - The Globe and Mail The French elites are in an advanced state of shock about the downfall of one of their own, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the man who was widely expected to be president. But the French elites are not like you and me. Instead of asking whether such a powerful, brilliant and successful man could be so coarse, reckless and stupid, they’re outraged about the perp walk. How dare the Americans humiliate him so? Pictures of the great man in cuffs are indicative of “a brutality, a violence, of an incredible cruelty,” declared Elisabeth Guigou, a former French justice minister. “I’m happy that we don’t have the same judiciary system.” Me too. The American system is infinitely more fair. In France, it’s unimaginable that an immigrant hotel maid of no status could lodge an assault complaint against an ultra-alpha male and be taken seriously. It’s inconceivable that the French police would pull that man off a plane moments before it departed or pack him off to a dingy jail cell like a common criminal. Good for them. If DSK had made it out of the country, it’s uncertain they’d have been able to extradite him. Of course, it’s up to the American justice system to prove Mr. Strauss-Kahn’s guilt or innocence, a job at which it is generally quite good. According to press reports, his lawyers won’t deny there was a sexual encounter in that $3,000 hotel room. Instead, they’ll argue that it was consensual. Mr. Strauss-Kahn’s sexual history was no secret among the French ruling class. But they didn’t care, and the media studiously ignored it. It would have been considered in grotesque bad taste (and possibly illegal) to bring these matters up. Besides, a certain amount of libertinage has always been admired among the political class, as a sign of vigour. The French have long despised the Americans as unsophisticated prudes in matters sexual. In their view, the prosecution of Bill Clinton for dallying with an intern in the Oval Office was a crime. They vigorously defended the creepy filmmaker Roman Polanski, who sodomized an adolescent girl. How dare those lowbrows persecute a great artist? As every intellectual in France entertained wild conspiracy theories about the right-wing plot to bring down DSK, it was left to far-right politician Marine Le Pen to speak the truth. DSK, she pointed out, had long been a menace, and now he is “completely discredited.” As everybody knows, powerful men are frequently afflicted with satyriasis – a near-uncontrollable inability to keep their pants zipped. So long as they don’t pay a price, they just keep unzipping. These men are frequently oblivious to the effects of their behaviour. They truly feel they are entitled. And they’re usually enabled by those around them. René Lévesque’s sexual behaviour bordered on the predatory, but he was popular with journalists, so they ignored it. Mr. Clinton would jump on anything that moved. Arnold Schwarzenegger fathered a love child with the household help and, astonishingly, managed to keep it secret for 14 years. At least that relationship was presumably consensual. The good news is that in Anglo-Saxon culture, this character flaw has become a serious liability for any man in public life. On this side of the Atlantic, it’s unlikely that DSK’s behaviour would have been tolerated by any major public institution. At the International Monetary Fund, by contrast, he kept his job even after a subordinate stated that he had pressured her into an affair. “I was damned if I did and damned if I didn’t,” wrote Piroska Nagy, an attractive Hungarian economist, in a letter to investigators. She wrote that her boss was “a man with a problem that may make him ill-equipped to lead an institution where women work under his command.” With his conspicuous wealth, his stupendous sense of entitlement, and his libertine tastes, DSK has more than a casual resemblance to the French aristocracy that the populace eventually dispatched to the guillotine. The bizarre reaction of the European socialist class suggests that they too are out of touch. On the whole, I prefer North America, where we expect the values of our rulers to more or less reflect our own. And when they don’t, we’re appalled."

122	Cokie and Steven V. Roberts: Rape often remains crime of blame-the-victim	"That is the most remarkable part of the sordid sex scandal ensnaring Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, who stands accused of attacking a maid in a New York hotel room.
Lawyers for Strauss-Kahn, a major figure in French politics known as DSK, claim he’s innocent.
He clearly follows the ancient tradition of “droit de seigneur” (yes, ironically, a French phrase) that literally means “the right of the lord."	"They listened to the woman. That is the most remarkable part of the sordid sex scandal ensnaring Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, who stands accused of attacking a maid in a New York hotel room. ?Powerful men have always manhandled vulnerable woman and gotten away with it. Victims often chose silence over justice because they feared that the criminal system would reject their accusations or, worse yet, blame them for the assault. The “blame-the-victim” syndrome is so pervasive that even an honorable institution like the Peace Corps fell into that pattern. A former volunteer, Karestan Koenen, recently told a congressional hearing that after she was raped in the African country of Niger, the official investigating the case told her, “I am so sick of you girls going out with men, drinking and dancing, and then when something happens, you call it rape.” Peace Corps scandal ‘’The treatment by the Peace Corps was worse than the rape,” said Koenen. If you replace “Peace Corps” with “military” or “university” or “police” or almost any other institution in our society, Koenen’s statement would apply to countless women who have been victimized twice: by a man who felt free to assault them and a system that felt free to ignore them. So the events in New York represent real change. The alleged victim had the courage to speak out. Her bosses took her seriously. The cops pulled Strauss-Kahn off a plane 10 minutes before it left for Paris. The district attorney charged him with attempted rape. The judge denied him bail. Lawyers for Strauss-Kahn, a major figure in French politics known as DSK, claim he’s innocent. But an assistant DA gave the court a graphic account: “The defendant restrained a hotel employee inside of the room. He sexually assaulted her and attempted to forcibly rape her.” For emphasis, he added: “The victim provided very powerful details consistent with violent sexual assault committed by the defendant.” Forensic evidence supported her “version of events.” Strauss-Kahn has gotten away with abusive behavior for years, protected by a French code that tolerates — and even admires — potent politicians. He clearly follows the ancient tradition of “droit de seigneur” (yes, ironically, a French phrase) that literally means “the right of the lord.” In medieval times, a nobleman could claim the virtue of his vassals’ daughters. In the modern version, a hotel maid will do if no virgins or vassals are handy. After years of cover-ups, the stories are now spilling out. Any American who wants to feel superior to the French should stifle the impulse. As that congressional hearing revealed, the Peace Corps has a poor record in dealing with sexual abuse. According to an ABC investigation, more than a thousand volunteers reported attacks between 2000 and 2009, but many others stayed silent because the Corps’ response to their complaints was often “callous, dismissive or woefully insufficient,” according to Koenen, the former volunteer. U.S. Army predators The army, if anything, is even more protective of predators. A recent lawsuit filed by 17 female soldiers against Defense Secretary Robert Gates, and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, alleges that they “ran institutions in which perpetrators were promoted ... in which plaintiffs and other victims were openly subjected to retaliation ... and ordered to keep quiet.” We don’t expect the world to change because one brave woman refused to keep quiet, and one powerful man found himself in a Manhattan courtroom, facing the consequences of his actions. But it’s a start."

Cuomo's little bro what was at the time an exclusive TV interview regarding former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn 's alleged use of prostitutes.
After the London Times interview hit the Internet, Davis agreed to talk to ABC and found herself being questioned by Chris, 40."	"ABC News correspondent Chris Cuomo may not have the juice to get Kristin Davis a pardon from his brother, but the former Manhattan Madam would appreciate it if he could exert some pull to get the interview she just did with him to air. Davis tells us that on Thursday, she gave Gov. Cuomo's little bro what was at the time an exclusive TV interview regarding former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn 's alleged use of prostitutes. The segment was supposed to run on Friday's installment of ""20/20,"" but it never did. Davis says the Disney -owned network went so far as to promote the interview during ""Good Morning America "" on Friday, but then didn't air any of it. A spokesman for ABC News tells us that the interview was ""cut for time"" and ""could still be used."" The network rep explains that the producers were doing a time line of the Strauss-Kahn scandal and had ""too much material"" for the time allotted. Davis has been in demand with the media since she gave an interview to The Times of London in which she claimed that Strauss-Kahn was once a client. Davis spent four months at Rikers Island for promoting prostitution in 2008. She was caught up in the wake of reports that former Gov. Eliot Spitzer , who she claims was a client, had used call girls. (Spitzer resigned as a result.) Last year, Davis ran for governor on a platform that included legalizing the world's oldest profession — and, along with then-attorney general Andrew Cuomo , participated in last October's gubernatorial debate. After the London Times interview hit the Internet, Davis agreed to talk to ABC and found herself being questioned by Chris, 40. She says she ""broke the ice"" by telling him that it was ""surreal"" to be talking to him after debating his sibling. She says Chris told her, ""Yes, we were very scared when we heard you were coming"" to the debate. Chris, she says, also deadpanned, ""I'm much more handsome than my brother."" During another  off-camera moment, Davis says she joked, ""Do you think you could talk to Andrew about a pardon?"" ""I don't have that much influence,"" she says he replied, then added, ""But you know you love Andrew."" Davis says that, in fact, she does like the job that the governor has done so far. She was less complimentary of Spitzer, whom, she says, she named in her interview with Chris about Strauss-Kahn's reportedly ""aggressive"" behavior with call girls. We talked about Spitzer,"" Davis says. ""We talked about why powerful men do the things they do. I told him it all comes down to ego. I called it the Spitzer Effect.""

125	Hotel maid denies HIV claim as fund chief quits	"DOMINIQUE STRAUSS-KAHN, in a New York prison on charges of attempted rape, has resigned from his post as managing director of the International Monetary Fund.
Mr Strauss-Kahn's departure came as Jeffrey Shapiro, the lawyer for the alleged victim, denied his client was HIV-positive.
The woman, a hotel maid, says she was attacked by a naked Mr Strauss-Kahn in his luxury Manhattan suite on Saturday.
The New York Post reported that the pair had lived at addresses rented exclusively to adults with HIV/AIDS and their dependents by a charitable foundation in Harlem."	"DOMINIQUE STRAUSS-KAHN, in a New York prison on charges of attempted rape, has resigned from his post as managing director of the International Monetary Fund. He tendered his letter to the board, expressing his ''infinite sadness'' that he felt ''compelled'' to leave his post, while denying all charges against him. Mr Strauss-Kahn's departure came as Jeffrey Shapiro, the lawyer for the alleged victim, denied his client was HIV-positive. The woman, a hotel maid, says she was attacked by a naked Mr Strauss-Kahn in his luxury Manhattan suite on Saturday. Mr Shapiro rejected US tabloid reports that the 32-year-old west African immigrant lives in housing in the Bronx made available to people with AIDS or HIV. ''Absolutely not,'' he told NBC's Today Show. ''She lived in a sub-let apartment in the Bronx.'' The woman, a widow, lives in the apartment with her teenage daughter. The New York Post reported that the pair had lived at addresses rented exclusively to adults with HIV/AIDS and their dependents by a charitable foundation in Harlem. The woman has accused Mr Strauss-Kahn, who had been seeking a run as the Socialist Party's candidate in the French presidential election next April, of forcing her to perform oral sex on him and then trying to rape her after she inadvertently disturbed him in his suite in the Hotel Sofitel, near Times Square, on Saturday. The woman, who has not been identified by authorities, and other hotel staff are believed to have testified before a grand jury investigating the allegations. The proceedings coincided with Mr Strauss-Kahn's resignation as managing director of the IMF after almost four years. ''I think at this time first of my wife - whom I love more than anything - of my children, of my family, of my friends,'' he said in a statement issued by the IMF. He added: ''To all, I want to say that I deny with the greatest possible firmness all of the allegations that have been made against me. ''I want to protect this institution which I have served with honour and devotion, and especially - especially - I want to devote all my strength, all my time and all my energy to proving my innocence.'' Mr Strauss-Kahn returns to court today for a new bail application in which his lawyers said the 62-year-old was willing to post $US1 million cash as bail and be confined to a location in Manhattan where he would wear an electronic ankle bracelet to monitor his movements. He remained locked up at the notorious Rikers Island prison, where he was sent after being formally charged this week. His lawyers have characterised the case as ''very defensible'', saying the forensic evidence would be inconsistent with a ''forcible encounter''. Reports suggested the defence would argue that any sex act had been consensual. Mr Shapiro said the claims would be exposed as bogus when a jury heard his client's story. ''There is nothing consensual about what took place in that hotel room,'' he said. Mr Strauss-Kahn was hauled off a Paris-bound Air France plane at John F. Kennedy Airport on Saturday afternoon and later charged with a criminal sex act, attempted rape and unlawful imprisonment. Police allege that the executive, who has steered the International Monetary Fund's financial rescue of Europe after the global financial crisis, had dashed to the airport after attacking the maid in his $US3000-a-night suite, leaving behind a mobile phone and other personal belongings in his haste. The maid had alerted hotel security about 1pm, accusing Mr Strauss-Kahn of dragging her along the floor and into a bathroom, where he assaulted her. He then allegedly tried to lock her in the room."
126	UN says IMF ties strong under Strauss-Kahn	"economics official says the world body's cooperation with the IMF was especially strong under Dominique Strauss-Kahn 's leadership.
He didn't comment on the former IMF chief's May 14 arrest in the alleged sexual assault of a hotel maid.
Strauss-Kahn, who resigned his IMF post last week, is under house arrest in a New York apartment on a total of $6 million in bond and cash bail."	"UNITED NATIONS A top U.N. economics official says the world body's cooperation with the IMF was especially strong under Dominique Strauss-Kahn's leadership. Jomo Kwame Sundaram, assistant secretary-general for economic development, told reporters Wednesday that the United Nations enjoyed a ""greater degree of coordination"" with the IMF when Strauss-Kahn was at the helm in recent years. He didn't comment on the former IMF chief's May 14 arrest in the alleged sexual assault of a hotel maid. Strauss-Kahn, who resigned his IMF post last week, is under house arrest in a New York apartment on a total of $6 million in bond and cash bail. World financial leaders are discussing his potential replacement as head of the multilateral lending institution."
127	DNA matches Strauss-Kahn in US sex attack	"New tests have found that the DNA of former International Monetary Fund leader Dominique Strauss-Kahn matches material found on the shirt of a New York hotel maid who says he attacked her, two people familiar with the investigation told The Associated Press."	"New tests have found that the DNA of former International Monetary Fund leader Dominique Strauss-Kahn matches material found on the shirt of a New York hotel maid who says he attacked her, two people familiar with the investigation told The Associated Press. The two people said that the tests were returned on Monday afternoon. They were not authorised to speak publicly about the matter and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity. They said DNA found on the maid's shirt matched to a sample of DNA from Strauss-Kahn, once a French presidential contender. Staff at the Sofitel Hotel also told authorities that he had made passes at them, including flirting with a clerk and calling another employee to ask her up to his room, according to a third person with direct knowledge of investigators' interviews with staff. That person also wasn't authorised to speak publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity. Strauss-Kahn lawyer Benjamin Brafman declined to comment on Monday. At a court hearing last week, he told a judge that forensic evidence developed in the investigation ""will not be consistent with a forcible encounter"" - leading to speculation that Strauss-Kahn's defence would argue that it was consensual. Strauss-Kahn had flirted with one female staff member who accompanied him to his luxury suite to make sure his accommodations were satisfactory after he checked in on Friday, May 13, the person said. Later, he phoned the desk clerk who had checked him in, asking her if she would like to get together with him when she got off duty, the person said. The desk clerk refused, saying she was not allowed to socialise with the VIP guest, the person said. On Monday, lawyers for Strauss-Kahn continued to search for new digs for the former IMF leader, who spent the weekend under house arrest. He is temporarily staying with his wife at a luxury high-rise in lower Manhattan. French and US media have been staking out the building where Strauss-Kahn was moved Friday from his Rikers Island jail cell. The 62-year-old is accused of attacking a 32-year-old housekeeper on May 14 in his $US3,000 ($A2,855)-a-night hotel suite. Strauss-Kahn faces charges including attempted rape and sexual abuse. He resigned last Wednesday from the IMF."

"WASHINGTON—Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the embattled managing director of International Monetary Fund, resigned Wednesday, saying he wanted to devote ""all his energy"" to battle the sexual assault charges he faces in New York. The IMF's executive board released a letter from the French executive Wednesday in which he denied the allegations lodged against him but said that with ""sadness"" he felt he must resign. He said that he was thinking of his family and that he wanted to protect the IMF. ""It is with infinite sadness that I feel compelled today to present to the executive board my resignation from my post of managing director of the IMF,"" the five-paragraph letter said. ""I think at this time first of my wife—whom I love more than anything—of my children, of my family, of my friends. I think also of my colleagues at the Fund. Together we have accomplished such great things over the last three years and more. ""To all, I want to say that I deny with the greatest possible firmness all of the allegations that have been made against me. I want to protect this institution which I have served with honor and devotion, and especially—especially—I want to devote all my strength, all my time and all my energy to proving my innocence."" Strauss-Kahn, who faced increasing international pressure to quit, announced his decision on the eve of a bail hearing Thursday that could have spelled the end of his leadership of the IMF anyway. He -------- -------- Advertisement -------- -------- faces charges of assaulting a maid at a New York hotel. The maid, a 32-year-old immigrant from the West African nation of Guinea, told police that the 62-year-old Strauss-Kahn came out of the bathroom naked, chased her down, forced her to perform oral sex on him and tried to remove her underwear before she broke free and fled the room. If a New York judge denies bail for Strauss-Kahn or imposes highly restrictive conditions on his freedom, the IMF's executive board would have expected him to resign, two senior IMF officials said earlier Wednesday. If he didn't, the board could have removed him on the grounds that he couldn't lead the IMF from a jail cell or far from its Washington headquarters. The two officials spoke on condition of anonymity because of the highly sensitive situation. Strauss-Kahn is jailed in New York City. Attempts to reach his lawyers were unsuccessful. The IMF's statement late Wednesday said the process of choosing a new leader would begin, but in the meantime John Lipsky would remain acting managing director. One of the IMF officials said earlier Wednesday that the fund had yet to speak with Strauss-Kahn since his weekend arrest. There were no procedures for suspending or placing its leader on extended leave. While Strauss-Kahn remains confined to a Rikers Island jail cell, the dividing lines are sharpening in a dispute over whether someone from a rich or an emerging economy should lead the IMF after his exit. Europe is aggressively staking its traditional claim to the top position. But fast-growing nations such as China, Brazil and South Africa are trying to break Europe's grip on an organization empowered to direct billions of dollars to stabilize the global economy. Europeans have led the IMF since its inception after World War II. Americans have occupied both the No. 2 position at the IMF and the top post at its sister institution, the World Bank. The World Bank funds projects in developing countries. Europe has ""an abundance of highly qualified candidates"" to lead the IMF, German government spokesman Christoph Steegmans declared Wednesday. He also noted the relevance of having a European at the helm, to deal with the debt problems that have racked the eurozone. Steegmans didn't name any potential candidates or say whether Germany might propose one. But German Chancellor Angela Merkel, along with the finance ministers of Sweden and the Netherlands, have pressed Europe's case for the IMF leadership. Still, developing nations see Europe's stranglehold on the position as increasingly out of touch with the world economy. China's is now the world's second-largest economy. India's and Brazil's have cracked the top 10. Many emerging economies are sitting on stockpiles of cash and have become forces of financial stability, while rich countries have become weighed down by debt. ""We must establish meritocracy, so that the person leading the IMF is selected for their merits and not for being European,"" Brazilian Finance Minister Guido Mantega said, calling for a ""new criteria"" for leadership. ""You can have a competent European ... but you can have a representative from an emerging nation who is competent as well."" China suggested it was time to shake things up at the IMF, with Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu saying the leadership ""should be based on fairness, transparency and merit."" And South African Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan spoke in stronger terms. He said the new director should come from an emerging economy, to ""bring a new perspective that will ensure that the interests of all countries, both developed and developing, are fully reflected in the operations and policies of the IMF."" It remains unclear which way the United States is leaning. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner had said Tuesday that Strauss-Kahn is ""obviously not in a position"" to run the IMF, escalating pressure on the 62-year-old economist. The United States has a major say in determining who will head the fund, in part because it holds the largest number of votes. The prevailing view among analysts and former Treasury officials appears to be that Washington would back a strong European candidate who could be approved in a smooth process. ""It's kind of not our fight,"" said Phillip Swagel, a Treasury official in the George W. Bush administration. ""There are very good reasons to have a forceful, prominent European head of IMF."" One such candidate would be French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde. Other Europeans touted as possibilities are Germany's former central bank chief Axel Weber; the head of Europe's bailout fund, Klaus Regling; and Peer Steinbrueck, a former German finance minister. Candidates from elsewhere include Turkey's former finance minister, Kemal Dervis; Singapore's finance chief Tharman Shanmugaratnam; and Indian economist Montek Singh Ahluwalia. More possibilities include Trevor Manuel, South Africa's former finance minister; Mexico's central bank governor, Agustin Carstens; and former Brazilian central bank president Arminio Fraga. Strauss-Kahn was removed from a plane Saturday at John F. Kennedy International Airport, moments before he was to fly to Paris. He was supposed to meet Sunday with German Chancellor Angela Merkel to discuss aid to debt-laden Greece and then join EU finance ministers in Brussels on Monday and Tuesday. Strauss-Kahn's flight from Washington was paid for by the IMF, with an approved stopover in New York, the official said. That meant his New York visit was in a private capacity. He was not accompanied by security personnel or any IMF aides. The official said Strauss-Kahn's security team was supposed to meet him at Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport. His assistants were already in Europe. ——— McHugh reported from Frankfurt. Associated Press writers Christopher S.

130	Questions and answers about Europe's debt crisis	"NEW YORK The arrest and resignation of Dominique Strauss-Kahn, chief of the International Monetary Fund, has put the debt troubles in Europe back in the news.
Why does the country need more?
The IMF plays a key role in negotiations between European countries, cajoling Germany and others into helping out weaker countries on the periphery of Europe like Greece, Portugal and Ireland.
A default by Greece or another European country could cause investors to be wary of government debt anywhere, they say."	"NEW YORK The arrest and resignation of Dominique Strauss-Kahn, chief of the International Monetary Fund, has put the debt troubles in Europe back in the news. The U.S economy has its own woes: stubbornly high unemployment, sluggish growth and $14 trillion in government debt. And that's just the short list. So why should you care about what's happening in Athens, Berlin or Brussels? Because markets are global and the economies of Europe and the U.S. are intertwined through trade and multinational company interests. Just the rumor that Greece, which is in danger of defaulting on its debt to lenders, might drop the euro as its currency sent U.S. bond yields to lows for the year. Here are answers to some questions about why Europe's troubles matter to the U.S.: Q: The European Union and the International Monetary Fund arranged a bailout for Greece last year. Why does the country need more? A: Greece wasn't actually ""bailed out."" Greece received a loan of 110 billion euros, or $157 billion, to help the country keep current on interest payments to banks and other bondholders and to calm markets. Greece got the loan after agreeing to deep spending cuts and tax increases. However that had the effect of shrinking Greece's economy by 4 percent, making it more difficult for the country to pay its debts. Many economists and politicians have criticized the loan terms. ""You do an over-borrowed nation no favors by lending it more money,"" writes Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, in a recent note to clients. Many economists are now convinced that lenders and borrowers would be better served by restructuring Greece's debt. That would mean cutting interest rates, extending the payback period or other similar measures. If an agreement can't be reached, however, Greece could default. Bond investors will partly determine when that happens. Uncertainty leads them to charge higher rates, making it harder to borrow. Q: How might the arrest and resignation of Strauss-Kahn factor into all this? A: Losing ""DSK,"" as he's known, leaves the IMF without its master negotiator at a crucial moment. The IMF plays a key role in negotiations between European countries, cajoling Germany and others into helping out weaker countries on the periphery of Europe like Greece, Portugal and Ireland. Many Germans resent using their money to cover other countries' debts. DSK had successfully persuaded these countries to contribute anyway. Europeans will likely fight to keep one of their own in the top spot. That's the usual arrangement: a European heads up the IMF, and an American runs the World Bank, which makes loans to developing countries. There's talk that Brazil, China and other countries may challenge that tradition. If the IMF's 187 member countries start squabbling over who takes Strauss-Kahn's place at a time when the IMF's leadership is most needed, analysts worry that a solution for Greece would stall. Q: If Greece or other heavily indebted countries like Portugal or Ireland run into more trouble, what will happen to the U.S. dollar? A: Worries over Europe typically drive down the euro and raise the dollar. That's evident in the dollar's 4 percent gain against the euro this month. ""The role of the dollar as a safe haven is quickly coming back into fashion,"" says Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers. ""All of a sudden the dollar is king again."" That's great news if you're headed to Europe this summer. But for U.S. exporters, it could be a problem. Q: What about U.S. government debt? A: Treasurys would also be likely to rise if Europe's debt troubles get worse. Even though the federal government has reached its $14 trillion debt limit, the world's bond traders still consider Treasurys one of the most attractive places to park their cash among an unattractive set of alternatives. ""That's the knee-jerk reaction,"" says David Kelly, chief market strategist at JPMorgan Funds. ""I wouldn't trust that knee-jerk reaction to be a long-term reaction."" Kelly is among those who think Greece's troubles offer a warning to the U.S. to get serious about a long-term plan to tackle its debts. A default by Greece or another European country could cause investors to be wary of government debt anywhere, they say. Treasury prices would drop and yields, which go in the opposite direction, would rise. That would make it more expensive for the government to borrow money. Q: What would a broader European crisis do to the U.S. stock market? A: Stocks would likely fall, analysts say. For starters, a stronger dollar makes U.S. goods more expensive to foreign buyers. It's akin to hiking prices on everything made in the U.S. Large U.S. companies are increasingly dependent on selling their products and services abroad. Companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 index get 20 percent of their profits from Europe, according to research from Bank of America. There's also the fear that a crisis could have unforeseen effects. If banks look like they'd be unable to cover insurance claims on European government bonds, it could make those who lend to banks nervous and cause interest rates to spike for companies and individuals. ""When there's trouble in one place everyone feels it,"" says Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank. ""Any big problem ends up being a problem for everybody."" Q: When all else fails, it seems people flock to gold and other commodities. Is this a good idea if there's a European crisis looming? A: Gold has been a popular place for nervous investors to hide their cash. Gold has jumped 67 percent since the financial crisis in 2008. So you'd think a crisis brewing in Europe would propel gold and even silver higher. The problem is that these hiding spots have become so popular that it's hard to estimate what gold and silver are actually worth. Over the past year, commodity markets have been flooded with cash from hedge funds and other traders making bets on higher inflation, says JPMorgan's Kelly. If Europe spawns a new debt crisis, worries about inflation in the U.S. will likely get tossed aside by fears of a wider meltdown. ""If everybody gets scared, commodities fall,"" Kelly says. In trader talk, gold and silver have become ""risk assets."" Simply put: When traders run from trouble, that's what they sell, driving prices down."

132	Ex-IMF MD Strauss-Kahn's semen found on maid's shirt	"New York: The semen of former managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Dominique Strauss-Kahn was found on the shirt of a hotel maid who alleged he tried to rape her.
According to the New York Daily News, DNA taken from Strauss-Kahn matched genetic material found on the shirt of the 32-year-old chambermaid who had alleged that the former IMF chief attacked her, tore at her clothes and tried to force her to perform oral sex in his hotel room on May 14."	"New York: The semen of former managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Dominique Strauss-Kahn was found on the shirt of a hotel maid who alleged he tried to rape her. According to the New York Daily News, DNA taken from Strauss-Kahn matched genetic material found on the shirt of the 32-year-old chambermaid who had alleged that the former IMF chief attacked her, tore at her clothes and tried to force her to perform oral sex in his hotel room on May 14. Investigators are still waiting for the lab results of carpet samples and swabs taken from the hotel sink. The maid reportedly spit in the sink after she told hotel security that she had been attacked. The test results were consistent with what law enforcement officials have said about the account provided by the woman, the New York Times said, citing a person briefed in the matter. They are also consistent with what Strauss-Kahn's lawyers have suggested would be his defence - that a sexual encounter had indeed occurred when she came to clean his room at the Sofitel New York on May 14, but that it was consensual. Meanwhile, the New York Post reported that Strauss-Kahn attempted to lure two attractive hotel employees to his $3,000-a-night hotel suite and later put the moves on an Air France flight attendant following his alleged sexual assault on a maid. ""What a nice ass!"" he said to the attendant, using the lewd French expression ""Quel beau cul!"" as she prepared the business-class cabin for takeoff last Saturday."
133	"With IMF head, NYC lawyer lands another big case"	"Now Benjamin Brafman, one of New York City's most prominent defense lawyers, finds himself in another legal pressure-cooker: the sex-assault case against International Monetary Fund leader Dominique Strauss-Kahn.
Combs walked after a Manhattan jury found him not guilty of toting an illegal handgun into a crowded Manhattan hip-hop club and later trying to bribe his driver to cover it up.
In the Burress case, Brafman engineered a 2009 guilty plea in another gun case that helped his client avoid a minimum 3 ½-year prison term."	"He's come to the aid of Sean ""P. Diddy"" Combs, ex-New York Giants star Plaxico Burress and, briefly, even the King of Pop. Now Benjamin Brafman, one of New York City's most prominent defense lawyers, finds himself in another legal pressure-cooker: the sex-assault case against International Monetary Fund leader Dominique Strauss-Kahn. Defense bar brethren of Brafman - a former prosecutor in the same district attorney's office now pursuing charges against Strauss-Khan - say his background representing beleaguered celebrities has hardened him for the challenges ahead both inside and outside the courtroom. They described him Tuesday as both tenacious and unflappable under fire. ""He's been there before,"" said veteran Manhattan defense attorney Gerald Lefcourt. ""He's certainly well-equipped to handle high-profile cases."" Added Lefcourt: ""He's careful in dealing with the press. That's the key here. Lawyers sometimes get overwhelmed and sidetracked. Not him."" Brafman, 62, ""is an absolutely wonderful and competent trial lawyer,"" said attorney Gerald Shargel, who recently defended the former television producer who tried to blackmail David Letterman. ""He's certainly in the top tier of trial lawyers in New York and maybe the entire country."" Brafman declined to discuss his involvement in the Strauss-Khan case Tuesday, other than to say he was brought on as co-counsel for the jailed Frenchman by Washington, D.C., lawyer William Taylor, ""who has known our client for many years."" Taylor has broad experience in civil and criminal matters in both state and federal court, according to a law firm website. He once represented Thomas McLarty, the former White House chief of staff for Bill Clinton, in the Whitewater inquiry. The two lawyers ""have worked on many important legal matters over the years,"" Brafman said. An Orthodox Jew who is the son of Holocaust victims, Brafman was raised in Brooklyn and Queens. He graduated from Ohio Northern University College of Law, and served as an assistant district attorney in Manhattan in the mid-1970s before building a defense practice by taking on disgraced clients in headline-grabbing cases. In 1998, Brafman stunned federal prosecutors in Brooklyn by winning an acquittal for Peter Gatien, a nightclub improsario who was accused of turning two of his Manhattan clubs into virtual drug supermarkets. A jury rejected the testimony of numerous cooperators who claimed drugs were openly sold inside the Tunnel and the Limelight, a former Sixth Avenue church converted into a club. Combs hired him to fight gun-possession charges at a trial three years later that caused another media frenzy. Combs walked after a Manhattan jury found him not guilty of toting an illegal handgun into a crowded Manhattan hip-hop club and later trying to bribe his driver to cover it up. In the Burress case, Brafman engineered a 2009 guilty plea in another gun case that helped his client avoid a minimum 3 ½-year prison term. Instead, the one-time Super Bowl hero is serving a two-year sentence for a firearms charge stemming from him accidentally shooting of himself at a Manhattan nightclub. Most recently, Brafman took on the ongoing corruption case of New York state Sen. Carl Kruger. Federal prosecutors allege Kruger pocketed more than $1 million in ""a broad-based bribery racket."" Brafman also joined Michael Jackson's legal team in 2004 to defend the superstar entertainer against charges he sexually molested a teenage boy. He left the defense before the case went to a trial where Jackson was acquitted. But in a television interview in 2009 shortly after Jackson died, Brafman said the experience left him with a sense of foreboding. Jackson, he said, was ""one of the loneliest people I've ever met."""

135	"For Maids In Manhattan, Unseemly Sights On The Job"	"Other hotel housekeepers say they've also found themselves facing problematic situations that — while not necessarily outright sexual harassment — have left them feeling uncomfortable.
"" Although most people's ideas of a hotel housekeeper might come from the movies like the romantic comedy Maid in Manhattan, the reality is a lot more grueling.
But according to Reneta McCarthy, a senior lecturer at the School of Hotel Administration at Cornell University, it's a very physical job."	"IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn's recent arrest is prompting other hotel maids to share stories of fending off men who approached them. Strauss-Kahn was arrested Saturday on charges of raping a housekeeper in a hotel near Times Square in Manhattan. Other hotel housekeepers say they've also found themselves facing problematic situations that — while not necessarily outright sexual harassment — have left them feeling uncomfortable. On WNYC, an NPR member station in New York City, host Brian Lehrer opened the phone lines to hotel housekeepers during his morning program over two days. Vivian Vasconcellos, who called in from Bronxville, N.Y., described this experience: ""He was this old guy; he was a regular. While in the room he used to leave the door open, not wide open, but a little bit open with a porno movie on. He knew we were there, cleaning the other room, and we could see that he was naked."" Although most people's ideas of a hotel housekeeper might come from the movies like the romantic comedy Maid in Manhattan, the reality is a lot more grueling. Most hotels in New York are unionized and housekeepers make between $15 and $20 an hour. But according to Reneta McCarthy, a senior lecturer at the School of Hotel Administration at Cornell University, it's a very physical job. Housekeepers might do 14 to 18 rooms a day, spending about 25 minutes per room. ""Typically,"" she says, ""the sheets the housekeepers are dealing with are not fitted sheets, so they have to pick up the mattress, and tuck them under, and tuck blankets. Those king size mattress are heavy; the queen size mattresses are heavy; they are vacuuming every room; they are scrubbing tubs, toilets, cleaning the bathroom floor."" When McCarthy would interview applicants, she would tell them the job was pretty much the equivalent of working a construction job. McCarthy believes sexual harassment is much less prevalent than most people suspect. 'Acting Like They Might Act At Home' None of the housekeepers who called the radio program said these things happened all the time, but Kathryn Carrington of Jersey City, N.J., who worked for the Grand Hyatt for about 30 years, says there were perhaps a dozen incidents in those years. Men would make passes at her, she says. ""If I am in the room, I just hurry up and leave them,"" she adds. ""Some of them would come up with towels around them, and plan to be dropping the towels. I would just go outside to the car and tell my supervisor I will go back to the room later, but I would like someone to be there with me, you know to escort me there."" Several housekeepers who called said the guests saw them as desperate, as if they were lucky to be approached and even acknowledged — the housekeepers were there for the guest's pleasure and needs. McCarthy says she came across only one serious sexual harassment experience during her years of work in hotels. ""But remember,"" she says, ""when a housekeeper comes to clean your room it's a personal experience. I mean, somebody is coming into your bathroom and touching your belongings, and making the bed, after you have slept in it. So for someone to open the door, and have a towel wrapped around their waist, I think the person is acting like they might act at home."" But of course they aren't. So perhaps there is a little confusion about boundaries here."

137	"Europe: Obama tends to old allies, new challenges"	"Weaving together strands of pomp, policy and summitry, President Barack Obama's weeklong European tour is all about tending to old friends in the Western alliance and securing their help with daunting challenges, from the political upheaval in the Mideast and North Africa to the protracted war in Afghanistan.
After his day in Ireland, Obama spends two in England, where he and first lady Michelle Obama will be treated to all the pomp and pageantry that the monarchy can muster for the president's first European state visit."	"Weaving together strands of pomp, policy and summitry, President Barack Obama's weeklong European tour is all about tending to old friends in the Western alliance and securing their help with daunting challenges, from the political upheaval in the Mideast and North Africa to the protracted war in Afghanistan. Obama's eighth trip to Europe as president, with a quick-moving itinerary that dips into four countries in six days, unfolds against the backdrop of the NATO-led bombing campaign in Libya and stubborn economic weakness on both sides of the Atlantic. A priority for the president and his allies will be to more clearly define the West's role in promoting stability and democracy in the Arab world without being overly meddlesome and within tight financial limitations. Obama, who departs late Sunday, will visit Ireland, England, France and Poland. Each is weathering an economic downturn that has forced European nations to adopt strict austerity measures. The U.S. has pushed its national debt to the limit, and Obama and congressional Republicans are in contentious talks about how steeply to cut spending. But never mind all that, at least for a moment. A highlight of Obama's opening stop in Ireland will be a feel-good pilgrimage to the hamlet of Moneygall, where America's first black president will explore his Irish _ yes, Irish _ roots, and most likely raise a pint. It turns out that Fulmouth Kearney, who immigrated to the United States in 1850 at the age of 19, is the third great-grandfather of Obama on his white, Kansas-born mother's side. Obama, whose father was born in Kenya, will connect in Moneygall with distant relatives from the Irish branch of his family tree. Michael Collins, the Irish ambassador to the United States, says the president's visit will be ""a golden moment"" for a country that's been on the economic ropes after its boom time. The visit is sure to play well at home for Obama _ make that O'bama _ as he heads into re-election season after being pushed to great lengths simply to prove he was born on U.S. soil. After his day in Ireland, Obama spends two in England, where he and first lady Michelle Obama will be treated to all the pomp and pageantry that the monarchy can muster for the president's first European state visit. The Obamas even get a Buckingham Palace sleepover. Though the United States and Britain remain the closest of allies, the relationship has been strained by recent events, including last year's oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico triggered by the explosion of an oil rig owned by British-based BP. Britain's unilateral announcement of a timetable for withdrawal of its 10,000 troops from Afghanistan also rankled the United States. Heather Conley, director of the Europe program at the private Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Obama's stop in Britain could help ""put the `special' back into the U.S.-U.K. special relationship."" Obama on Wednesday will become the first American president to speak to members of Parliament from the historic Palace of Westminster. European leaders are eager to see how president frames the U.S.-European partnership at a time when Obama has prodded Western allies to shoulder greater responsibility in areas such as Afghanistan and Libya. A NATO-led mission is working to protect civilians and assist the rebel fighters trying to oust Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. In private, Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron will plunge into the details of a host of international challenges on which the U.S. and Britain have worked together: Afghanistan, Libya, counterterrorism, the global economy and more. Both leaders then scoot to a French summit of the Group of Eight industrialized nations, where the president hopes to build on momentum from his speech days ago about how best to promote stability and democracy in the Middle East. Obama has called on the World Bank and International Monetary Fund to present the G-8 with an ambitious plan to help Egypt and Tunisia, in particular, recover from the disruptions caused by their democratic revolutions and prepare for elections later this year. The U.S. and its allies don't want those elections to occur against a backdrop of economic chaos that could increase support for extremists. But there's no expectation of a big aid measure emerging from the G-8. Rather, the countries in the region will present their plans for democratization and stabilizing their economies, and the G-8 will consider ways to help. Although not on the official agenda, the G-8 leaders are sure to be talking about future leadership of the IMF now that former chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn has resigned after being arrested on attempted rape charges in New York. European leaders are anxious to put another European in that position while emerging economies would like to see a process that is open to someone from the developing world. U.S. officials have said they favor an open process, without being more specific. Obama's visit to Europe comes a little more than a month before the U.S. is scheduled to start its gradual troop withdrawal in Afghanistan. The president has said the initial drawdown will be significant, but it's unclear how many specific answers he'll have for European leaders. Britain and France, in particular, are looking for details on the U.S. withdrawal timetable for signs of how NATO will move from combat missions to a training role by the end of 2014. The Afghan mission is deeply unpopular in many European countries, and political pressure has led some leaders to set timetables for their withdrawal. The British are planning to draw down 400 of their nearly 10,000 troops this year, with all British troops out by the end of 2014. France, which has 4,000 troops in Afghanistan, has said it is considering speeding up its withdrawal now that al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden is dead. During his two-day stay in Deauville, France, Obama will take time for one-on-one meetings on the side of the G-8 with several world leaders, including Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan. The U.S.-Russia relationship, though much improved since the Bush administration, remains complex. Medvedev has spoken out strongly in recent weeks against U.S. plans to plant missile interceptors in Romania as part of a U.S. shield over Europe, saying that could threaten Russia. He's warned that Washington's failure to cooperate with Russia on the missile shield could lead to a new arms race, and also threatened to pull out of the New START nuclear treaty with the U.S. if Russia feels at risk. Obama's meeting with Kan would be his first with the Japanese prime minister since the March tsunami and earthquake that triggered a nuclear crisis in Japan. The U.S. has sent military and humanitarian assistance to Japan, as well as nuclear experts, to help the country recover from the disaster. Obama's visit to Poland is emblematic of a growing front in the administration's engagement in Europe, as the U.S. expands its economic and security relationship with Central European nations. Robert Kupiecki, Poland's ambassador to the United States, says Central Europe's experiences in moving toward democracy offer many lessons that are ""directly applicable"" in the Middle East and North Africa, and that Poles and others in the region are anxious to help the democratic movement spread. Lech Walesa, the former Polish president who founded the Solidarity freedom movement, has visited Tunisia, and Walesa will meet with Obama in Poland to talk about the experience. Obama can point to Poland, with its stable government and growing economy, as a benefactor of democracy's virtues."
138	Cartoon: Strauss-Kahn Sex Scandal	"(French Revolution) This excellent cartoon by Pat Bagley from The Salt Lake Tribune relates to the sex scandal involving former IMF boss Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who has been charged with attempting to rape a New York hotel chamber maid (see previous post ).
COMMENTARY The cartoonist makes an ironic play on the expression 'the rights of man'.
In the cartoon, however, the rights of man appear to have more to do with the right to have sex with whomever takes your fancy, and generally behave in a 'piggish' way towards women."	"(French Revolution) This excellent cartoon by Pat Bagley from The Salt Lake Tribune relates to the sex scandal involving former IMF boss Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who has been charged with attempting to rape a New York hotel chamber maid (see previous post ). With his reference to 'piggish behavior' ('behaviour' in British English), the cartoonist could also be thinking about former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger among others (see this article from TIME ). The cartoon is based on the famous painting 'Liberty Leading the People ' by the 19th century French romantic artist Eugène Delacroix . In the original painting Delacroix depicted Liberty as both an allegorical goddess-figure and a robust woman of the people. In Pat Bagley's cartoon she has become an object of sexual desire, being pursued by 'piggish' men, including a trouserless DSK. COMMENTARY The cartoonist makes an ironic play on the expression 'the rights of man'. The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (Déclaration des droits de l'Homme et du Citoyen) is a fundamental document of the French Revolution, defining the individual and collective rights of all the estates of the realm as universal. In the cartoon, however, the rights of man appear to have more to do with the right to have sex with whomever takes your fancy, and generally behave in a 'piggish' way towards women. COMMENTS 1. Never mind the rights of man, what about the rights of women ? 2. Describing Strauss-Kahn's alleged behaviour as 'piggish' seems very unfair to pigs.

140	Virility a virtue or a vice?	"No, says noted sexologist Dr Prakash Kothari.
This compulsive desire is different from a man having numerous affairs - that's done with consent.
"" High levels of the male hormone are often associated with the aggressive, confident and swashbuckling alpha male but it can just as well be found in a poor schoolteacher in some small town, points out Dr Ambrish Mithal, president of the Endocrine Society of India.
These primitive parts take over the rational side, says Dr Rajat Mitra, director of Swanchetan Society for Mental Health, a Delhi-based NGO."	"Dominique Strauss-Kahn may be in the dock for it, but he isn't the first. History is littered with libidinous stories about powerful men. Picasso , Richard Burton , JFK, Bill Clinton , Jacques Chirac were famously attractive to - and attracted by - women. Roman Polanski, Julian Assange and Mike Tyson , appeared to have uncontrollable libidos and indulged in risky and shocking behaviour. Is high testosterone the culprit? No, says noted sexologist Dr Prakash Kothari. ""High testosterone does not necessarily lead to this type of risky behaviour. Desire by itself doesn't lead to immediate arousal. A heady sense of power and opportunity along with a base of desire can lead to destructive, almost psychopathic behaviour, which leads to forcible sex. This compulsive desire is different from a man having numerous affairs - that's done with consent. But interestingly, both types could have the same levels of testosterone."" High levels of the male hormone are often associated with the aggressive, confident and swashbuckling alpha male but it can just as well be found in a poor schoolteacher in some small town, points out Dr Ambrish Mithal, president of the Endocrine Society of India . Rajat Kumar (name changed), a 38-year-old spice merchant is a case in point. His testosterone levels were so high that sex was a mania for him all day, every day. At night, he would make love to his wife, in the morning to his secretary and in the afternoon, to a prostitute. Sex became such an obsession he finally sought treatment. Contrary to general perception, high testosterone does not mean a man has any particular physical characteristics. A strong jaw, thick hair or a muscular build are no indicator. Neither is the size of the male organ. ""Longer is better is Godzilla logic,"" says Kothari. ""A scrawny-looking man may have the same hormonal levels as a stud."" Often enough, the 'stud' image favoured by the film industry is simply a marketing style but egotistical actors may start to believe in it. Director Mahesh Bhatt says that ""behind all the posturing of being a civilized society lies a primordial man, a narcissist who thinks he can get away with anything. Bollywood is no different. The testosterone story of the Bollywood male is as heart-breaking and fictitious as the sex bomb who lures you in a porn magazine. It's just a scintillating road show to make films sell. Unfortunately, few are sane enough to realize it's just an illusion. You are actually what you hide."" Testosterone levels do affect psychology. In some men, impulsiveness is associated with the more primitive parts of the brain. These primitive parts take over the rational side, says Dr Rajat Mitra, director of Swanchetan Society for Mental Health, a Delhi-based NGO. ""Such men have vivid, colourful fantasies and are driven to rape. Most don't want intimacy in relationships as they find that too complex to deal with."" Mahesh Bhatt says that compulsive sexual acts by powerful men may be the result of genuine need. ""Most lead lonely and stressful lives and sexual escapades are (like) numbing ice packs. Few are able to balance committed love with sexual novelty."" So how much testosterone is too much? ""That will be when the need for sexual gratification goes beyond your own rational limits. This could vary in individuals. About 3-4% of my patients suffer from high sexual desire,"" says Kothari. Downers include chemical castration - men are injected with female hormones.

141	Strauss-Kahn to trade jail for New York apartment	"NEW YORK (AFP) - After a humiliating four-night stay in Rikers Island jail, Dominique Strauss-Kahn awaited release Friday to a New York apartment where he will be under constant video surveillance.
Jeff Shapiro, a lawyer for Strauss-Kahn's accuser, has said that his client, who has not been identified except by some in the French media, was ""alarmed"" at the prospect of her alleged attacker leaving jail."	"NEW YORK (AFP) - After a humiliating four-night stay in Rikers Island jail, Dominique Strauss-Kahn awaited release Friday to a New York apartment where he will be under constant video surveillance. Lawyers for Strauss-Kahn, who is accused of sexually assaulting and attempting to rape a 32-year-old Guinean chambermaid, convinced a judge on Thursday to release him on bail pending trial, under very strict provisions. The 62-year-old veteran politician has resigned as head of the International Monetary Fund under the weight of a scandal that has also ended any hope he had of replacing Nicolas Sarkozy as French president in 2012. The case has sent ripples around the globe, setting off a heated battle between Europe and emerging powers over who should fill his role at the world lender, which is bailing out failing economies left, right and center. French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde is tipped as a likely successor but developing nations such as Brazil, Mexico and China have urged a rethink of the conventional wisdom that an IMF chief has to come from Europe. Strauss-Kahn's lawyers were to sign the bail paperwork Friday, posting $1 million bail and an insurance bond of $5 million so he can move in to an apartment rented by his wife, American-born French journalist Anne Sinclair. There was no official confirmation of the location, but journalists were staking out a plush apartment complex on East 65th Street on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Services included a 24-hour doorman and concierge. Under the terms of the bail deal, Strauss-Kahn must wear an ankle monitoring bracelet and be under 24-hour surveillance, meaning the flat would have to have video cameras installed. Strauss-Kahn will also face strict visitation restrictions and have at least one armed guard as part of the elaborate deal, which came at an estimated personal cost to the defendant of more than $200,000 a month. Camille, Strauss-Kahn's daughter by a previous marriage, lives nearby on the Upper West Side as she completes her graduate studies at Columbia University. A grand jury has voted to indict the Socialist power baron on all seven charges related to the sexual assault and attempted rape of a maid on Saturday in his luxury suite at Manhattan's Sofitel hotel. Strauss-Kahn has denied all charges and is expected to enter a plea of not guilty at his next court appearance on June 6. He could spend the rest of his life in prison if found guilty. ""Under American law, these are extremely serious charges,"" Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance told reporters after Thursday's bail hearing. Hordes of journalists besieged the courthouse and packed into the courtroom where Strauss-Kahn exchanged several quick looks with Sinclair. Wearing a clean shirt and suit without a tie, Strauss-Kahn blew a kiss to his wife, who responded in kind. During attorneys' arguments, Sinclair sat holding hands with Camille, who was in tears. Strauss-Kahn was escorted on Saturday afternoon off an Air France flight bound for Paris, minutes before take-off. The prosecution contends he was seen rushing from his hotel room after the alleged attack, but the defense says he was simply late for lunch with someone who will testify to that effect, reportedly his daughter. ""The proof against him is substantial. It continues to grow every day,"" Assistant District Attorney John McConnell told Thursday's hearing. US media say police have taken forensic evidence from the hotel, including bodily fluids taken from a section of rug where the alleged victim remembered spitting after she says Strauss-Kahn forced her to perform oral sex. Jeff Shapiro, a lawyer for Strauss-Kahn's accuser, has said that his client, who has not been identified except by some in the French media, was ""alarmed"" at the prospect of her alleged attacker leaving jail. She alleges that the former IMF chief groped and mauled her in his room and forcibly tried to have oral sex with her. She testified on Wednesday and Thursday before the grand jury that later decided to send the case to trial. Strauss-Kahn's lawyer Benjamin Brafman said earlier this week the evidence ""will not be consistent with a forcible encounter,"" suggesting the defense could seek to argue at trial that whatever happened was consensual."

"(IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn ) International Monetary Fund managing director Dominique Strauss-Kahn in Manhattan criminal court in New York. Photographer: Richard Drew/Pool via Bloomberg French women’s groups are criticizing what they say is the lack of attention the hotel maid at the center of Dominique Strauss-Kahn’s alleged rape attempt is getting from politicians and the country’s media. They point out that the torrent of reaction has all but ignored the 32-year-old woman because of a so-called code of silence when it comes to the alleged victims of powerful men like Strauss-Kahn, the head of the International Monetary Fund . “The maid is invisible and the IMF chief gets the support,” Clementine Autain, who was raped at the age of 23 and co-founded Paris-based feminist group Mix-Cite, wrote on her blog. “The decency that everyone talks about would require that they have at least a word for the woman.” Comments like Autain’s are forcing politicians to note that beyond presuming Strauss-Kahn’s innocence, they need to spare a thought for the housekeeper at the Sofitel hotel in Midtown Manhattan who Strauss-Kahn is charged with attempting to rape in his suite. Prime Minister Francois Fillon said yesterday that there should be “respect and compassion” for “the alleged victim.” The case, with its image of a haggard Strauss-Kahn handcuffed and led away by New York police officers, has shaken France. A former finance minister, Strauss-Kahn, 62, is being held without bail at New York’s Rikers Island jail complex while awaiting his next court appearance on May 20. Strauss-Kahn, who had been the leading Socialist Party contender for the French presidential elections in May 2012, didn’t enter a plea at his May 16 court hearing. He denies the charges, his lawyer Benjamin Brafman said. ‘A Shock’ “It’s traumatic,” Socialist presidential candidate Francois Hollande said today on Radio Classique. “In France it’s not possible to broadcast images of a trial. In the U.S., it’s the rule. With the images circulating, they have force. They create a shock.” Several French politicians have questioned the allegations, saying it was unlikely the man they know would have done what he’s accused of, effectively challenging the version of the alleged victim, a native of Guinea who has been in the U.S. for seven years. Her lawyer, Jeffrey Shapiro, from New York’s Jeffrey J. Shapiro & Associates LLC, said she has a 15-year-old daughter and, until the attack, lived in the borough of the Bronx in New York City . She speaks English and French. “She did not know who he was and did not see him before,” Shapiro said yesterday. “This is a woman who does not have an agenda. She did what she was told to do, which was report this.” ‘Can’t Believe It’ According to the criminal complaint, Strauss-Kahn “engaged in oral sexual conduct and anal sexual conduct with another person by forcible compulsion.” He allegedly closed the door of the room to keep the woman from leaving, grabbed her breasts and tried to pull down her pantyhose, according to court papers. “I, who have known him for 30 years, I cannot believe it,” Pierre Moscovici, a Socialist lawmaker, said on France 2 Television yesterday. Immediately after his arrest, Strauss-Kahn’s Socialist Party colleagues asked that he be treated with decency and respect without once mentioning the hotel maid. More than half of French people think that Strauss-Kahn is the victim of a conspiracy, according to an opinion poll carried out by the CSA agency. Fifty-seven percent said there was a plot against him while thirty-five percent said that this wasn’t the case. Eleven percent didn’t reply. The survey was carried out on May 16 by telephone with a sample of 1,007 people, the CSA said on its website, giving no margin of error. Rape Taboo Mix-Cite , the feminist group that launched a campaign called “shame must change sides” in November to bring more openness to issues surrounding rape, yesterday denounced the lack of sympathy for the alleged victim, Agence France-Presse reported. “I am very surprised that politicians and commentators never cite the possible victim,” Arnaud Leparmentier, a senior politics correspondent for Le Monde newspaper, said in an interview. “They don’t do it because they are so France- centered that they can’t even think of a modest, black, maid victim.” Thalia Breton, a spokeswoman for “Dare Feminism,” another feminist association, said sexist remarks in the blogosphere have “minimized” the gravity of the case. “In France there is a tradition of libertine habits and respect of one’s private life, but rape is a crime,” she said. “Dare Feminism” published a statement yesterday on its website on the Strauss-Kahn case. Breton said she received several e-mails that noted the ”unease” some felt with the silence surrounding the maid. New Tone Breton says there are 75,000 rape cases every year in France and that with “a real taboo surrounding rape in this country,” only 10 percent of those women file complaints. Following criticism from feminist groups, the tone of the case’s coverage in France is beginning to change. French Environment Minister Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet told Le Figaro ’s website yesterday that “when we talk about this case, we must mention that there is an alleged victim.” In a May 16 interview on Canal Plus television, she had said that “France’s reputation” was “a forgotten victim.” Socialist Party First Secretary Martine Aubry called for “respect” for the victim, and Green Party chief Cecile Duflot called for “justice for the young woman” and “justice for Strauss-Kahn who has the presumption of innocence,” Agence France-Presse reported yesterday. Television journalist David Pujadas opened last night’s much-watched 8 p.m. France 2 news show by saying, “Strauss-Kahn spent his first night in jail. He is silenced. Meanwhile, there is a victim, a young mother of 32.” To contact the reporters on this story: Helene Fouquet in Paris at Hfouquet1@bloomberg.net .

(Jefferson Siegel) By Ben Fractenberg DNAinfo Reporter/Producer MANHATTAN — Disgraced ex-IMF boss Dominique Strauss-Kahn denied the explosive sex charges against him in an ""au revoir"" note to colleagues. ""I deny in the strongest possible terms the allegations which I now face,"" Strauss-Kahn wrote to bankers in an e-mail, which was forwarded to staffers by IMF acting head John Lipsky Sunday evening. It was then obtained by CNN . Strauss-Kahn told his colleagues he felt ""profound sadness and frustration in having to leave under these circumstances."" The French banker portrayed himself as selfless for resigning after he was arrested on rape charges for allegedly trying to force himself on a maid at his posh Manhattan hotel. ""The (IMF) — and you dear colleagues — should in any way have to share my own personal nightmare. So, I had to go,"" he wrote. ""What the institution has achieved in the last three and a half years is the fruit of your thinking, your work, your conviction."" The note signs off: ""Thank you, good luck for the future, and au revoir. Dominique."" Strauss-Kahn remains in a rented apartment at 71 Broadway in lower Manhattan. He was refused a place to stay on the Upper East Side. Columbia University also told a judge it didn't want him staying in the grad student apartment occupied by his daughter in Morningside Heights. Staffers for Manhattan Supreme Court Administrative Law Judge Michael Obus said they hadn't heard from Strauss-Kahn's lawyers about any plans to move to a more permanent home pending trial. Strauss-Kahn faces up to 25 years behind bars on a string of sex charges. He allegedly fondled a hotel maid cleaning his suite at the Sofitel Hotel in Midtown on May 14.

"(Bristol Plaza Denies Dominique Strauss-Kahn An Apartment ) CORAL GABLES (ALLATE) – Bristol Plaza of New York has allegedly denied Dominique Strauss-Kahn an apartment for his bail arrangements. Bristol Plaza located on 210 East 65th Street was thrust into the Dominique Strauss-Kahn case this week when bail arrangements allegedly paid by Strauss-Kahn’s wealthy wife Anne Sinclair. The plans would have resulted in his housing in the swanky building pending trial. But now, within the hour, news reports claim that the Bristol Plaza has backed out of the plan. A stunning sky rise located in New York City’s upper east side, the Bristol Plaza boasts it is “better than a hotel”. The facility proclaims that it “provide guests seeking long-term stays with luxurious accommodations” and can offer “the comforts of home together with the first class services the frequent traveler has come to expect.” Piroska Nagy Pictures Piroska Nagy Photo 1 Piroska Nagy Photo 2 Piroska Nagy Photo 3 Judge Michael Obus in a ruling yesterday authorized bail but told news and Straus-Kahn that the bail could be revoked “if there is the slightest problem”. The security team is reportedly set to be picked from Stroz Friedberg, the same company that worked for Bernard Madoff. But in a news report today, the Telegraph claims that on Friday the apartment deal was dead. “Managers … appeared to back out of a deal for him to live there under house arrest” claimed the Telegraph. The same report has been confirmed by news website France24. In fact, rather than just “appear[] to back out”, managers according to France24 have reportedly made a decision; Strauss-Kahn is not welcomed. “New York’s upscale Bristol Plaza refused to rent him a room”. The Bristol reportedly told Strauss-Kahn’s team that it had “difficulties in finding an apartment”.

Telecom rose 0.4 percent to NZ$2.38 but Air New Zealand slipped 0.9 percent to NZ$1.12 and Fletcher Building was down 0.9 percent to NZ$9.00."	"HONG KONG—Asian shares rose Wednesday as dealers moved in after two poor performances at the start of the week, with Tokyo lifted by a weaker yen and strong results from computer giant Dell. Hopes for an end to the European debt crisis lifted the euro despite concerns that discussions could be hit by the detention of IMF head Dominique Strauss-Kahn on sexual assault charges in the United States. Tokyo gained 0.99 percent, or 95.06 points, to 9,662.08, Hong Kong added 0.48 percent, or 110.06 points, to 23,011.14 and Shanghai ended up 0.70 percent, or 20 points, at 2,872.77. Seoul put on 1.59 percent, or 33.37 points, to end at 2,135.78. Sydney gained 0.21 percent, or 9.8 points, to 4,693.7 but suffered a late sell-off after Moody’s downgraded its credit rating on Australia’s big four banks, citing volatile global lending markets. Tech stocks in Japan were lifted after US firm Dell announced on Tuesday that net profit nearly tripled to $945 million in the first three months and predicted revenue growth for the April-June period. Traders were also given a boost after a report said chipmaker Renesas had laid out a plan to bring post-quake production near Tokyo back up to full speed in October, earlier than expected. “Dell’s outstanding numbers blew away investors’ concerns that consumer spending is slowing down globally, especially after the March 11 disaster in Japan,” Tatsunori Kawai, chief strategist at kabu.com Securities, told Dow Jones Newswires. The Nikkei was also boosted by a relatively weaker yen as hopes rose the European sovereign debt crisis can be solved after a 78 billion euro bailout for Portugal was signed off and talks continued over further help for Greece. Leading eurozone policy-maker Jean-Claude Juncker said a “soft restructuring” of Athens’ 330-billion-euro debt is a possibility as an EU-IMF mission in Athens was extended by one week. The euro gained to $1.4275 in Tokyo trade, up from $1.4234 in New York late Tuesday. The single European currency held on to most of its gains against the yen, standing at 115.72 in Tokyo, little changed from 115.79 yen in New York. The dollar slipped against the Japanese yen to 81.08 yen from 81.36 yen. Although the yen gained in the afternoon it was still lower than recent weeks. “The possibility of all-encompassing measures to help restore confidence in Greece and Portugal’s bailout appears to have provided the euro a platform for short-term strength,” said Chris Gore, currency analyst at GOMarkets in Sydney. There had been worries over the talks as Strauss-Kahn was trusted by both lenders and borrowers among the eurozone and his arrest came at a key time for struggling nations. The IMF chief was held at the weekend over claims he attempted to rape a New York hotel maid and has been refused bail. “The more significant driver of currencies was US dollar weakness,” said National Australia Bank in a client report. “This came on the back of disappointing US data releases that caused the market to question the durability of the US recovery,” it said. Confidence in the economic strength of the United States was knocked after data showed housing starts tumbled 10.6 percent from March to an annual rate of 523,000, lower than analysts’ projections of about 563,000. Building permits also fell 4.0 percent from the prior month to an annual rate of 551,000, well below expectations. The figures hurt the Dow, which ended down 0.55 percent. In Sydney the Big Four banks were sold near the end of trade after Moody’s cut its rating on them to Aa2 from Aa1. The Big Four includes Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac, and National Australia Bank. Shares of all four declined from their intra-day highs after the decision but National Australia Bank and ANZ still managed to finish up, while Commonwealth and Westpac were only marginally in the red. On oil markets New York’s main contract, light sweet crude for June delivery advanced 79 cents to $97.70 a barrel and Brent North Sea crude for July delivery gained 60 cents to $110.59.

Commodity rally sends stock indexes higherNEW YORK (AP) _ Widespread gains in commodity prices lifted energy and materials companies as part of a broad stock market rally Wednesday after three days of declines. Stocks built on morning gains after the Federal Reserve released minutes that showed that officials agreed that the economy is improving, which could lead to higher demand for raw materials like steel and fertilizer. The Fed's bond-buying program has kept interest rates low and sent commodities and stock prices higher overall since late August. The U.S. stock market has gained nearly 25 percent since the central bank signaled that it would begin the asset-purchase plan. Commodity prices had fallen over the last two weeks after months of gains on concerns about the impact of high energy prices on the economy. Fed considers tighter credit as economy improvesWASHINGTON (AP) _ The Federal Reserve said last month that the economy is gradually improving and began discussing how it would reverse policies adopted during the recession that pumped billions of dollars into the economy. Some members said the Fed might need to start boosting interest rates this year to guard against inflation. Any effort to tighten credit would lead to higher rates on some mortgages, credit cards and other consumer loans. French agape over treatment of jailed IMF chiefPARIS (AP) _ The trans-Atlantic gap separating the U.S. and French justice systems and moral codes is as wide as the ocean itself _ appalling a nation witnessing the unraveling fortunes of a favorite son, jailed IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn. Some of the charges leveled against Strauss-Kahn in the alleged sexual assault of a hotel maid in New York do not exist in France. And if the case was being heard in France, the 62-year-old IMF chief might risk three to five years in prison instead of scores in the United States, a leading expert says. He also likely wouldn't be sitting in a notorious jail right now on a suicide watch. GM to increase Volt production to 60,000 per yearDETROIT (AP) _ General Motors says it will reconfigure the factory that makes the Chevrolet Volt so it can produce up to 60,000 electric cars per year. Currently the plant in Detroit can make about 16,000 of the cars annually. High used-car prices make it ideal time to sellDETROIT (AP) _ It's the best time in years to sell your car. People are holding on to cars and trucks for about a year longer than they did before the recession, which has created a tight supply of used vehicles. So few are on the market that prices have risen to their highest in at least 16 years. AP Sources: Chrysler has deal to repay gov't loansDETROIT (AP) _ Chrysler is close to repaying its government bailouts. The company has lined up investors to help it refinance $7.5 billion in loans from the U.S. and Canadian governments, three people briefed on the matter said Wednesday. Under the deal, the company would take out $2.5 billion in bank loans and sell $3.5 billion worth of bonds to investors. Italy's Fiat, which has management control of Chrysler, would kick in $1.3 billion more to raise its stake in the U.S. carmaker. Oil settles higher, gas pump prices still slidingNEW YORK (AP) _ Investors seized on the weaker dollar Wednesday to buy a wide range of commodities, including oil, which reversed two days of losses to settle above $100 per barrel for the first time in a week. Benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude for June delivery rose $3.19, or 3.3 percent, to settle at $100.10 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew, Pool)) Photos of > -------- -------- -------- -------- NEW YORK: Investigators found traces of DNA from former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn on the clothes of a hotel maid who accused him of sexual assault, US media reported on Monday. The DNA was found on the shirt of the 32-year-old worker at the Sofitel in New York who has accused Strauss-Kahn of attempting to rape her, according to NBC and ABC television. DNA testing on other evidence from the hotel suite used by the French politician is continuing. Strauss-Kahn has denied charges made against him. New York police and the District Attorney's office refused to comment on the reports which came as Strauss-Kahn raced against time on Monday to find a new home. He has also told former staff how he is confronting a ""personal nightmare."" Under house arrest pending trial, he has been rejected by one luxury residence because of his newfound notoriety and must soon leave his temporary abode. Charges that he attempted to rape and sexually assault the chambermaid on May 14 forced him to resign as head of the International Monetary Fund last week and torpedoed his chances of standing in the French presidential election next year. But Strauss-Kahn again denied the accusations in an email message sent to IMF staff late Sunday in which he expressed ""profound sadness"" at the way he left his $450,000-a-year tax-free post. ""I deny in the strongest possible terms the allegations which I now face; I am confident that the truth will come out and I will be exonerated,"" he wrote. ""In the meantime, I cannot accept that the Fund - and you dear colleagues - should in any way have to share my own personal nightmare. So, I had to go."" Strauss-Kahn is holed up in the Empire Building at 71 Broadway, where management has apologised to residents and said that the new arrival will be gone by ""early"" this week. His wealthy wife, French television journalist Anne Sinclair, had previously arranged a $15,000 a month apartment on the Upper East Side. But Strauss-Kahn was rejected after residents complained about the bad publicity. Sinclair left the Broadway apartment for a few hours on Sunday on what was believed to be part of the new hunt for a home. She has suspended her blog about American life. ""Dear reader, many, many many of you have sent me messages,"" Sinclair wrote. ""I cannot answer everybody, but know that these touched me and helped me."" ""You will understand the circumstances that have forced me to temporarily suspend this blog. All I can say is, a bientot."" While Strauss-Kahn gets used to bail life wearing an ankle bracelet and being forced to stay in an apartment under the watch of video surveillance and and armed guard around the clock, the legal battle is heightening even before his next court appearance on June 6 to make a formal plea. His lawyer Benjamin Brafman has said Strauss-Kahn will plead not guilty and that he is confident his client will go free. ""He has impressed me very much. Despite the circumstances, he's doing well,"" Brafman told the Israeli newspaper Haaretz in an interview. The defence team has hired a posse of private investigators who, according to media reports, are already sifting through the 32-year-old accuser's personal history in New York and her native Guinea in West Africa. Prosecutors told Strauss-Kahn's bail hearing last week that they are also building a ""strong"" case in support of the accusations. Strauss-Kahn was arrested on an Air France flight just as it was about to leave New York's John F. Kennedy airport, a few hours after the alleged attack. He spent the first days in detention at the notorious Rikers island jail. He now faces seven counts, including the attempted rape charge. Ian Weinstein, a law professor at Fordham University in New York, said that if convicted at trial, ""a sentence of 10 years in prison is entirely likely, and a sentence higher than that is entirely possible."" - AFP/de"

TAMER EL-GHOBASHY: Yes.
GWEN IFILL: Elaine Sciolino, in Paris, in France, how is this all being received?
We cannot possibly imagine that Dominique Strauss-Kahn could be guilty of this kind of crime.
Now, I have to note that he's not representing her in the criminal case, nor is there a civil case at this point.
And he said that there has been no conversation about a civil case against Mr. Strauss-Kahn.
GWEN IFILL: Elaine Sciolino and Tamer El-Ghobashy, thank you both very much."	"What we heard in court was that they don't believe that there's -- there was any -- there is any forensic evidence to support a coerced sex act. In addition, what they're saying is that he -- this narrative that he left the hotel in a hurry to JFK Airport and boarded a flight to France was an attempt to flee, they believe that's false. They -- they say they have evidence and will have testimony from people who will testify that they met with Mr. Strauss-Kahn after he left the airport, and they can place him there, showing that he was in no hurry to leave and that he indeed did nothing wrong. GWEN IFILL: You mean after he left the hotel and before he went to the airport. TAMER EL-GHOBASHY: Yes. GWEN IFILL: But prosecutors, who we assume are repeating the story or the version of events provided by the complainant, they are saying they have forensic evidence, you mentioned. For instance, what would that mean? TAMER EL-GHOBASHY: They are saying that they're testing certain items removed from the hotel room, including some section of carpeting that may have DNA evidence that they believe belongs to Mr. Strauss-Kahn, in addition to the complainant's narrative of what happened. And, also, they're building their case around video surveillance and interviews with other witnesses who may have come into contact with the complainant after this alleged event and also with Mr. Strauss-Kahn. GWEN IFILL: Elaine Sciolino, in Paris, in France, how is this all being received? ELAINE SCIOLINO, The New York Times: There's been an evolution in the thinking here, Gwen. The first reaction was disbelief. We cannot possibly imagine that Dominique Strauss-Kahn could be guilty of this kind of crime. ""This is not the man I know,"" said one political leader from his party. Then that followed -- was followed by rage, especially after the arraignment, where he appeared unshaven, he had no tie and he had also been handcuffed, which is -- under French law, is not acceptable, to show a defendant -- a defendant handcuffed. So, now there's been another sort of movement in people's thinking, and there is starting to be sympathy for the -- the woman, the victim. People are now raising the question of whether or not there should be changes in sexual harassment traditions or laws here in France. GWEN IFILL: I saw a poll, which maybe is dated by now, showing that 57 percent of French people thought that he was a victim of a conspiracy. Is that shifting? ELAINE SCIOLINO: Well, exactly, as you -- you used the word dated by now. It was done on Monday and things have changed since then, as the sort of reality has sunk in and some more details are unfolding. Also, polls in France -- and you know this from your days covering politics -- polls in France are not like they are in the U.S. GWEN IFILL: Well, Elaine, you have been in Paris for some time and you probably have some sense of not only the politics, but kind of the cultural difference between the way these sorts of things are perceived there and the way they're perceived here. Does that explain part of the bad feelings, at least in the beginning? ELAINE SCIOLINO: It does, because there is a sort of preservation of what's called vie privee, private life. And, frankly, it's not a liability for a politician to have had a lot of extramarital affairs. It's very different from the United States. And the whole chattering class, journalists, politicians, business leaders, will tell you the fact that Dominique Strauss-Kahn was rumored to have a very active extramarital sex life wouldn't have been a factor in him being elected president. GWEN IFILL: Tamer El-Ghobashy, let's talk a little bit more about the woman in this case. What do -- do we know anything more about her, about her background, about the charges that she brought? TAMER EL-GHOBASHY: Sure. We have been learning a little bit about who she is. Of course, traditionally, here in the United States, victims of sexual crimes, or alleged victims of sexual crimes, their names are not released by authorities. However, her name has leaked and it's appeared in foreign media. But what we know about her has been through an attorney that's been hired on her behalf. Now, I have to note that he's not representing her in the criminal case, nor is there a civil case at this point. And he said that there has been no conversation about a civil case against Mr. Strauss-Kahn. However, he's been acting as sort of a spokesman for her and has provided a few details about who she is. She's 32 years old. She lives in the Bronx. She's a single mother of a 15-year-old girl. She's been working at the Sofitel Hotel in Midtown for three years as a chambermaid. She arrived in the United States about seven years ago from Guinea as a -- she had received asylum here in the United States. What the circumstances of that asylum was and what conditions -- under what condition she left her home country are not clear at this point. What we know is that she's widowed. Her husband died at some point under, at this point, unknown circumstances. She's been described as a devout Muslim woman who -- who really has no criminal record, or has been an anonymous New Yorker up until this point. GWEN IFILL: And she is no longer anonymous. Do we know where she is or whether she has even been seen in public? TAMER EL-GHOBASHY: According to her attorney and several law enforcement officials I have spoken to, she's in an undisclosed, secure location. She hasn't been able to return to her home, primarily because there's hordes of media outside waiting for her from presumably all over the world. She just recently was reunited with her daughter, I believe yesterday, for the first time since the incident. So we haven't seen her in public. She has visited the Special Victims Unit here in New York, where she was being interviewed by detectives. She's also visited the district attorney's office. And, today, she's -- was due to or may have already testified in front of a grand jury. There are -- she was covered in a sheet when she did appear in front of some news cameras to protect her identity. GWEN IFILL: Elaine Sciolino, let's make a distinction here, because you make it in your book and other places, between kind of the attitude that the French have toward, as you pointed out, people in extramarital relationships or people who have very high-profile sexual lives and people who may be accused of criminality. Is that a dividing line in this case? ELAINE SCIOLINO: It is, but I would argue that, if the media had been more aggressive at the time that Dominique Strauss-Kahn was named the head of the IMF, perhaps this unfortunate event, whichever -- whatever it will turn out to be, could have been prevented, because there already had been a French woman, a journalist, who had come forward and accused Dominique Strauss-Kahn of attempted rape. She never prosecuted him because she was advised by her mother not to do it. Taking on the powerful in France is very, very difficult to do. But had there been a real tradition of investigative reporting and investigating inside the bedroom, maybe we wouldn't be here today. GWEN IFILL: Elaine Sciolino and Tamer El-Ghobashy, thank you both very much. TAMER EL-GHOBASHY: Pleasure. ELAINE SCIOLINO: Thank you. (SUPPORT YOUR PBS LOCAL STATION)"

) Wednesday's screening comes a day after Sarkozy's father, Pal, was quoted in Germany's Bild newspaper as saying that the French leader and his current wife - former model-turned-singer Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, who he married less than a year after taking office - are expecting a child."	"(Cast and crew arrive for the screening of The Conquest at the 64th International Film Festival, in Cannes. Photo / AP) Cast and crew arrive for the screening of The Conquest at the 64th International Film Festival, in Cannes. Photo / AP Politics gets personal in The Conquest, a vivid re-imagining of French President Nicolas Sarkozy's rise to power and the simultaneous unraveling of his marriage. As the first French leader to divorce - and then remarry - while in office, Sarkozy's real-life saga is the stuff of soap operas, and director Xavier Durringer treats it as such, viewing the five years of political jockeying that preceded Sarkozy's 2007 election through the lens of his relationship with then-wife, Cecilia. Hyped as a behind-the-scenes glance at the private lives of the Sarkozys, The Conquest is arguably the most highly anticipated French movie at the Cannes Film Festival, where it screened Wednesday. Still, a disclaimer at the beginning of the movie proclaims it is a work of fiction ""based on the lives of real people,"" and Durringer, too, insisted he wasn't worried about the film's historical accuracy. ""No one can say - even the politicians themselves, can't say - that things happened exactly like this or that,"" Durringer said at a news conference. The strength of the movie lies in the performances of its cast, whose imitations of the scions of recent French politics - from Sarkozy's aging predecessor, former President Jacques Chirac, to his main rival, the patrician, silver-hailed Dominique de Villepin - are spot on. Denis Podalydes' Sarkozy deserves special mention. Though his physical resemblance with the diminutive, thick-haired leader is limited, Podalydes bristles with the electric energy and nervous tics that earned Sarkozy the nickname, ""The Energizer Bunny"". He also gets Sarkozy's voice and speech patterns down so well viewers could be forgiven for thinking the conservative politician dubbed his own voice. (He didn't.) In fact, Sarkozy has said he wouldn't go to see the film. ""In general, I don't read what is written about me,"" he said in an interview with Telerama magazine. ""That's because I'm never happy. If it's critical, I find it unjust; if it's flattering, it's not flattering enough. ... So what's the point?"" In the movie, Sarkozy comes off as a basically nice guy with ego issues. At one point, he shouts at his advisers, ""Don't forget, I'm a Ferrari. When you open the lid, you need to wear gloves."" Durringer focuses on Sarkozy's softer side, often hidden from the public by his sharp-edged public image. On election day, when he knows himself hours away from the presidency, we see an unshaven Sarkozy in the doldrums because Cecilia refuses to go vote with him. (That actually happened in real life.) Wednesday's screening comes a day after Sarkozy's father, Pal, was quoted in Germany's Bild newspaper as saying that the French leader and his current wife - former model-turned-singer Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, who he married less than a year after taking office - are expecting a child. The president already has three sons from two previous marriages, and Bruni-Sarkozy has a young son. The screening also comes as France digests the sex-assault case against Frenchman Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the International Monetary Fund chief who was widely seen as the Socialist Party's best hope of beating Sarkozy in presidential elections next April. -AP By Jenny Barchfield"

Internet gambling by PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker and Absolute Poker."	"By LARRY NEUMEISTER Associated Press NEW YORK (AP) - A Chicago man pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges Monday, admitting that he helped Internet poker companies find banks to process millions of dollars in gambling proceeds even though he knew it was illegal. Bradley Franzen, 41, also signed a cooperation agreement, agreeing to testify if necessary at any trial to result from a government prosecution that has already caused the three largest online poker companies to shut down their U.S. operations. Franzen was one of 11 people charged last month in the probe. He pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in Manhattan to conspiracy to commit bank fraud, accepting funds in connection with illegal gambling and conspiracy to commit money laundering. The charges carry a potential prison term of up to 30 years but the plea agreement calls for prosecutors to recommend leniency at an Aug. 26 sentencing if Franzen cooperates fully. Franzen admitted he illegally helped link gambling companies with banks by using shell companies and phony websites. He said he began doing so after he was first contacted in 2009 at his Costa Rica home by an Internet poker company owner who wanted to process checks online but knew that banks were not doing so and were not permitted to accept the proceeds of Internet gambling. Magistrate Judge Kevin Fox, who heard the plea in place of a district judge, asked Franzen if he knew how much money was processed as a result of his help. ""It was millions of dollars, but I don't know how much,"" Franzen said. His lawyer, Sam Schmidt, declined to comment. The prosecution has resulted in the shutting down of U.S. Internet gambling by PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker and Absolute Poker. Prosecutors say the poker companies obtained about $3 billion illegally by letting people in the U.S. gamble on their websites. ___ Follow Larry Neumeister at http://twitter.com/Lneumeister Copyright 2011 The Associated Press.

Mayor unruly By Annie Thomas The corruption trial of France’s former president Jacques Chirac can go ahead, a top appeals court ruled on Friday, rejecting a constitutional challenge."	"Forever in debt By Guy Adams and David Usborne Innocent until proven guilty, and with a $1m bail cheque burning a hole in his prison jumpsuit, Dominique Strauss-Kahn’s release from New York’s notorious Rikers Island jail descended into farce on Friday, after he was unable to find a suitable venue for his court-ordered house-arrest. The former IMF chief, who is accused of the attempted rape of a chambermaid in the suite of his hotel last weekend, was left twiddling his thumbs after the management of an upscale Manhattan apartment complex where his wife Anne Sinclair had rented a temporary residence declared him to be persona non grata. Ms Sinclair, who in public has remained vehemently supportive of her 62-year-old spouse, was forced to embark on a search for alternative accommodation, after the Bristol Plaza on East 65th Street pulled out of a deal to provide a residence for the couple. A long-standing resident of the building, where two-bedroom flats rent for around $14,000-a-month, is believed to have complained at the prospect of having him for a neighbour. The development left Strauss-Kahn in legal limbo until a judge ruled shortly before 5pm that his conditions for bail had been met. It appeared Friday night that Strauss-Kahn would move first to temporary housing from which he would not be allowed to stray for any reason. As well as armed guards and video cameras, the doors from the residence would be alarmed. Once he has moved, presumably with his wife, to more long-term accommodation pending his trial, Strauss-Kahn will be allowed out but only for medical or legal appointments. There was no information on Friday night on what kind of temporary abode had been found. Under an agreement negotiated on Thursday, the man who was until this week tipped as a future French president was to be freed on $1m bail, provided he surrendered his passport, wore an electronic ankle bracelet, and agreed to spend the months leading up to his trial under supervised house arrest. He is unable to leave New York or move into a hotel. That presents a strategic problem, since residents of city’s upscale apartment complexes are notoriously choosy about the people permitted to live next door. Ms Sinclair, a French journalist, is certainly not short of money. She is sole heir to her grandfather, a wealthy art dealer called Paul Rosenberg. Strauss-Kahn has backed his bail with the deeds to his wife’s $4m house in Washington DC. He has also agreed to pay $200,000-a-month for armed guards to ensure that he doesn’t attempt to escape. “They are certainly permitted to use reasonable force necessary to restrain or to prevent his escape,” his lawyer told the court. “That, however, will not be a problem with this client, who is intent on coming to court to clear his name.” As journalists and TV crews gathered at Rikers Island awaiting the inmate’s release, the IMF’s finances were coming under scrutiny. Before his resignation, Strauss-Kahn was earning roughly $530,000 a year, and he is likely to be paid $300,000 in compensation for quitting the job. His pension will provide another $318,000 per year. Governing lust By Dan Morain You have to wonder how many lies Arnold Schwarzenegger has told and whether he can keep them all straight. California’s former first couple’s marriage is disintegrating in full view, the result of Schwarzenegger’s transgression more than a decade ago in which he fathered a son by one of his household employees. Amazingly, the woman remained on his domestic staff and payroll through January, according to the Los Angeles Times, which first disclosed the sordid tale. We’ll learn far more in the coming days about this episode and others. It will be fodder for Internet gossip sites and print and television tabloids. I feel sympathy for Maria Shriver and her children, and question whether Schwarzenegger is embarrassed, or if he is beyond embarrassment. This past weekend, he was seen yukking it up over lunch and cigars at a Beverly Hills restaurant with his old pal, Sylvester Stallone, not at all humbled. Voters knew that Schwarzenegger was a lout when they elected him in the 2003 recall, as the Los Angeles Times had detailed how he had groped and fondled women over the years, leaving them angry, humiliated and distraught. In such reporting efforts, reporters pursue leads that don’t pan out, or can’t be nailed down sufficiently to print. Such was the case with this project. But plenty was known. Here is one passage: Now, as she walked along 19th Street, Schwarzenegger conveyed a sense of urgency: “Come close, it’s very important.” As she drew nearer to his car to hear what he had to say, she recounted, Schwarzenegger “grabbed and squeezed” her. “If I were a man,” she said she told him, “I would bust your jaw.” As tears welled in her eyes, she said, Schwarzenegger laughed. “He thought it was hilarious.” Powerful stuff. For it, the paper was vilified. The Times media columnist James Rainey recalled last week that 10,000 subscribers canceled their subscriptions in the wake of the story. As Schwarzenegger and many others have discovered, people believe what they want to believe, Shriver among them. At the campaign’s request, she stood by her man, declaring as recall day neared that he is “an extraordinary father, a remarkable husband and a terrific human being.” If his wife could forgive him — until, that is, she learned of the child he fathered — who were we to pass judgment about his transgressions? After he took office, however, a different pattern of deceit developed. He cut up oversized credit cards to dramatise that he would end deficit financing. He proceeded to plunge the state deeper into debt. He promised to “blow up the boxes,” not merely move them around. It didn’t happen. Jerry Brown, his successor, is the one seeking to abolish 43 useless boards and commissions, and consolidate several departments. Affairs happen. He has offered an apology. Californians are a forgiving bunch, though, again, there is much we don’t know. He assumes they’ll continue to attend the movies he makes. Mayor unruly By Annie Thomas The corruption trial of France’s former president Jacques Chirac can go ahead, a top appeals court ruled on Friday, rejecting a constitutional challenge. Lawyers for one of the co-defendants of Chirac, who is accused of embezzling public funds as mayor of Paris in the 1990s, had argued that some of the charges were unconstitutional under the statute of limitations. The country’s highest appeals court ruled however that the constitutional concerns raised, which caused the trial to be postponed on its second day in March, were not valid. The court “decided that there was no grounds to refer these questions to the Constitutional Council,” the body that would have ultimately ruled on the challenge, the judges said in a statement. Chirac, 78, the first former French president to go on trial, is accused of using public funds to pay people working for his party ahead of his successful 1995 election bid. He has denied knowledge of any illegal payments. A court on March 8 suspended the trial so that constitutional authorities could examine whether certain charges that date back nearly two decades were still admissible. The postponement drew criticism from anti-corruption campaigners. Chirac is one of France’s most popular political figures, best known abroad for opposing the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq. He is the first French former head of state to face criminal charges since the leader of the collaborationist wartime regime, Marshal Philippe Petain, was convicted of treason after World War II. If found guilty, Chirac faces up to 10 years in jail and a fine of $210,000 on charges including embezzlement and breach of trust. State prosecutors, who are under the hierarchical authority of the government, have called for the case to be dismissed, raising the likelihood that Chirac will avoid conviction. Paris city hall last year dropped its civil charges against him in return for a payment of more than 2.2 million euros, from him and the right-wing UMP party. Chirac paid more than half a million euros of this from his own pocket but did not acknowledge any wrongdoing. Juppe was convicted in the same case in 2004, received a suspended jail term and was banned from holding public office for a year. President Nicolas Sarkozy named him foreign minister earlier this year. There have been reports that Chirac’s health has deteriorated — perhaps even to the point where he could avoid trial. In January his wife Bernadette Chirac denied media reports that he was suffering from Alzheimer’s and insisted he would face up to his trial, though she admitted his health had declined. The presiding judge in March proposed that trial hearings be rescheduled for around June 20. Agencies"

"French President Nicolas Sarkozy reportedly warned Dominique Strauss-Kahn about his womanizing before he left for the United States in 2007. Strauss-Kahn, a former economics professor and minister of the economy and finance from 1997 to 1999, had a reputation in France for being sexually aggressive, CBS News reported. Sarkozy, who supported his appointment as head of the International Monetary Fund, warned him mores are different in Washington, The Times of London said. ""Over there they don't joke about this sort of thing,"" Sarkozy said, according to the Times. ""Your life will be passed under a magnifying glass. Avoid taking the lift alone with interns. France cannot permit a scandal."" Strauss-Kahn is being held at Rikers Island in New York after being charged with sexually assaulting a maid at a Manhattan hotel. The French newspaper Liberation reported after his arrest that in an April 28 interview Strauss-Kahn suggested a woman might make up a story about being attacked in a parking lot to win large damages, CNN said. He also suggested his reputation is overblown. A poll by the Conseil Sondage Analyses, or Council of Polling Analysis, found more than half, 57 percent, of those surveyed in France think Strauss-Kahn is a victim, not a perpetrator.

158	"IMF Chief Resigns, Denies Sex Assault Charges"	""" The IMF chief faces an array of charges, including two counts of first-degree criminal sexual act, one count of first-degree attempted rape, one count of first-degree sexual abuse, one count of second-degree unlawful imprisonment, one count of forcible touching and one count of third-degree sexual abuse."	"NEW YORK (CNN) -- The head of the International Monetary Fund has resigned amid mounting calls he step down after being jailed on charges he sexually assaulted a maid in his upscale hotel suite. In a brief letter to the IMF executive board late Wednesday, Dominique Strauss-Kahn proclaimed his innocence. He said he was stepping down to ""protect this institution which I have served with honor and devotion, and especially -- especially -- I want to devote all my strength, all my time and all my energy to proving my innocence."" ""To all, I want to say that I deny with the greatest possible firmness all of the allegations that have been made against me,"" he said. The resignation came as his attorneys are preparing to appeal Thursday to New York's Supreme Court to release their client on bail. He has agreed to post $1 million in cash, to be confined to home detention in Manhattan with electronic monitoring and to turn over his U.N. travel document to ""eliminate any concern that Mr. Strauss-Kahn would or could leave this court's jurisdiction,"" attorney Shawn P. Naunton wrote in the appeal. A tentative deal was in the works that could result in his release on bail as early as Thursday, a source close to the defense told CNN. The appeal adds a number of conditions, including electronic monitoring, which were not in a bail request turned down Monday by a criminal court judge in Manhattan. The appeal to the state Supreme Court describes the accused as ""a loving husband and father, and a highly regarded international diplomat, lawyer, politician, economist and professor, with no prior criminal record."" It also said Strauss-Kahn has been married for more than a decade and has four children from a prior marriage, one of whom is a graduate student at Columbia University in New York. The case has captured worldwide attention since Strauss-Kahn was pulled off an airplane and charged with the sexual assault and attempted rape of a 32-year-old Guinean maid in his hotel suite. His arrest has set French political circles abuzz as the international economist was widely considered the French Socialist Party's best hope to unseat President Nicolas Sarkozy in next year's elections. Calls for Strauss-Kahn's resignation mounted in recent days. U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said he was ""obviously not in a position to run the IMF."" Austria's finance minister Maria Fekter urged him to step down. ""He should think about whether he is damaging the institution,"" Fekter said. In his letter, Strauss-Kahn said he felt compelled to resign. ""I think at this time first of my wife -- whom I love more than anything -- of my children, of my family, of my friends,"" he wrote. ""I think also of my colleagues at the Fund; together we have accomplished such great things over the last three years and more."" While the search begins to replace him, John Lipsky will continue as acting managing director, the IMF said in a statement. Prosecutors allege that a naked Strauss-Kahn, 62, chased the housekeeping employee through his Manhattan hotel suite on Saturday and sexually assaulted her. But his attorney Benjamin Brafman disputed the allegation, saying ""forensic evidence, we believe, will not be consistent with a forcible account, and we believe there is a very, very defensible case."" The IMF chief faces an array of charges, including two counts of first-degree criminal sexual act, one count of first-degree attempted rape, one count of first-degree sexual abuse, one count of second-degree unlawful imprisonment, one count of forcible touching and one count of third-degree sexual abuse. Strauss-Kahn is accused of attacking the maid about noon, shortly before he checked out of the Sofitel. The maid, according to a law enforcement official, followed hotel policy by putting her cart in the open doorway of the suite when she went to clean it. After lunch, he was driven to John F. Kennedy International Airport and boarded an Air France flight, authorities said. As he sat in first class awaiting takeoff and a planned meeting the next day with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin, followed by a meeting with European finance ministers on Monday in Brussels, his world of luxury and power came crashing down. Police, alerted by hotel staff to the maid's accusations, ordered him off the plane and placed him in custody. Strauss-Kahn was examined for scratches and DNA samples were taken, and investigators searched for other evidence in the suite, including possible bodily fluids from both individuals, a law enforcement official told CNN. He consented to the testing after investigators prepared a search warrant, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The official was not authorized to release the information.

We know that he was the potential challenger of French president Sarkozy."	"Zsolt Bayer, the Hungarian writer infamous for his virulent anti-Semitism has published an anti-Semitic diatribe against Dominique Strauss Kahn: “Strauss-Kahn and his IMF had their dicks sucked by half the world before the chambermaid did. The world sucked them off for money […] so Strauss-Kahn thought after a while why a chambermaid should resist him, when half the world is sucking him off. […]” “We could leave it at that […]. We could lean back satisfied and think about how Strauss-Kahn wanted us [Hungarians] to suck him off about a year ago and how we disappointed him. […]” “Let’s see what we know about this ‘Strauss-Kahn’ except for the fact that he is the president of the IMF and likes oral sex. We know that he was the potential challenger of French president Sarkozy. This brutal, sickening old pig (er?szakos, undorító vén disznó) would have been the left’s candidate against Sarkozy. […]” “We know how lucky Sarkozy was during the last election. Do you remember? The suburbs of Paris were burning. The Arabs and other colored [sic] immigrants had set towns ablaze and went on a rampage, beating up and killing people. And while the liberal intelligentsia issued stupid statements worldwide, the French middleclass realized in the blaze of burning suburbs that they were definitely fed up with the multicultural nonsense forced on them by the likes of Strauss-Kahn [here “Jews” K. P.] because of their business interest. And while Sarkozy’s the opponents uttered the usual politically correct rubbish, Sarkozy declared unmistakably that he was fed up too and would make order. And the French middle class run off with tears in their eyes to give him their vote. And if one can’t see any anti-Semitism in Bayer’s text there are the comments of his readers on the moderated Blog of Magyar Hirlap: In comment # 114 DSK is called a “matzo-devourer” and # 119 states explicitly: “It’s interesting how unrestrained the sons of the chosen people are. While Cohn-Bendit rapes children, Strauss-Kahn frightens good looking women with his circumcised dick.” Both the owner of Magyar Hirlap and the author Zsolt Bayer are close personal friends of the Hungarian prime-minister Viktor Orbán as can be seen on a photo published on March 30, 2011.

160	IMF acting head strengthens expectation European will get post	"The acting managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), John Lipsky, has hinted that French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde could head the organization but said the process of selection would be open and merit-based.
Lipsky has been in caretaker charge of the IMF since Dominique Strauss-Kahn resigned on Thursday following allegations of attempted rape.
Speaking at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington on Thursday, Lipsky said the agency's executive board would make the decision expeditiously."	"The acting managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), John Lipsky, has hinted that French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde could head the organization but said the process of selection would be open and merit-based. Lipsky has been in caretaker charge of the IMF since Dominique Strauss-Kahn resigned on Thursday following allegations of attempted rape. The 62-year-old Frenchman, who denies all the accusations against him, was indicted on Thursday and released on $1 million bail but placed under house arrest. Speaking at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington on Thursday, Lipsky said the agency's executive board would make the decision expeditiously. ""There's been agreement among our membership that the process of selection of the managing director should be open, transparent and merit-based,"" Lipsky said. Although there have been growing calls for the post to go to a non-European, with CIS members led by Kazakhstan and Russia uniting around Kazakh central banker Grigory Marchenko , many analysts have suggested that France's Lagarde would be a perfect choice. ""Of course, she's a very, very talented and capable leader,"" Lipsky said, adding that she was ""one of many names that have been mentioned."" ""Many names have been mentioned in the press. I'm happy to say many of them - a long list of them - seem extremely talented and well-qualified individuals."" German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said the next IMF head should hold a European passport, but experts say she would rather see former Bundesbank president Axel Weber in the agency's chair. Lipsky said the IMF is ""fully capable to carry out its duties"" while the leadership issue is being dealt with. ""To think that the institution was one man, however talented he might be or talented she might be, is an illusion,"" he said. ""In the past it's been a matter of a couple of months because there's a selection process and then whomever is selected may not be available to appear immediately. I expect a process that is very straightforward and normal."" MOSCOW, May 20 (RIA Novosti)"

"Third-time candidate Pyeongchang did what it needed to bolster its strong position, stressing it has kept all promises to the IOC through a decade of bidding and pitching the games to a new winter sports market in Asia. Munich enhanced its credentials as the main challenger, while Annecy showed it has improved dramatically in recent months and should not be counted out. ""I think it's very close,"" IOC President Jacques Rogge said. ""Don't ask me numbers, but it's going to be a close race, definitely. I don't expect a big gap between the three cities."" The South Koreans brought new star power to the show, with reigning Olympic figure skating champion Kim Yu-na making her international debut to promote Pyeongchang's bid. Another figure skating star, two-time Olympic gold medalist Katarina Witt, chairs the Munich bid. ""I was so much more nervous than when I was competing in the Olympics, but I think it went well,"" the 20-year-old Kim said. ""I had a little bit of a mistake, but nobody noticed, I hope. I'm very satisfied and happy that I did well."" Asked what score she would give her performance Wednesday, Kim said: ""10, yeah."" Reedie said IOC members were impressed by Kim's presentation. ""To have Miss Kim presenting as fluently and as wonderfully well as she did, it was very good for Pyeongchang,"" he said. Each city had 45 minutes for presentations featuring speeches and videos, followed by another 45 minutes for questions and answers. Rogge said members asked a total of 27 questions. The IOC said 88 of its 110 members attended the briefings at the Olympic Museum. On Thursday, the members will visit the candidate cities' exhibition rooms at a Lausanne hotel and have face-to-face meetings with bid leaders. In the day's only unusual twist, one IOC member sought to raise the issue of IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn's arrest on sex assault charges in New York. Hicham el Guerrouj, a two-time Olympic gold medalist distance runner from Morocco, began to ask Annecy officials about the impact of the Frenchman's case on their bid. But Rogge cut him off, saying the question was out of place. Pyeongchang, bidding again after narrow defeats in the voting for the 2010 and 2014 Olympics, has been widely considered the favorite from the start as it seeks to bring the Winter Games to a new hub in Asia. The Winter Olympics have been held twice in Asia, both times in Japan (Sappporo 1972 and Nagano 1998). Citing a 92 percent public approval rating, by far the highest of the three candidates, Pyeongchang said its bid was a ""national priority."" Foreign Minister Kim Sung-hwan noted that South Korea had spent $1.4 billion in developing an Olympic-caliber ski resort in the Alpensia mountains and is working on a high-speed rail link between Seoul and Pyeongchang. Munich, the 1972 Olympic host which is seeking to become the first city to stage both summer and winter games, has been trying to counter Pyeongchang's status as favorite by pushing its argument for taking the games back to their European roots in a country with a long winter sports tradition. Witt said the choice of an Olympic host city is ""about more than just geography,"" a reference to Pyeongchang's case for taking the Winter Games to Korea for the first time. ""It is a choice about the kind of Olympic experience the athletes of the future should have,"" she said. American IOC member Anita DeFrantz asked the Germans about the terrorist attack at the 1972 Munich Olympics that left 11 Israeli athletes and coaches dead. ""The mayor (Christian Ude) could explain that the incident in '72 had nothing to do with Munich as a city or with Germany,"" said Thomas Bach, an IOC vice president who is a senior Munich bid leader. ""It was just the beginning of international terrorism, and we appreciated this question to make this clear."" Annecy is seeking to establish itself as a true contender after being seen as a longshot for much of the race. After going through financial and leadership troubles, the bid has been strengthened in recent months. ""I think we are all three even now,"" IOC member and French ski great Jean-Claude Killy said. ""We showed we are a good team. We have a good proposition. We are proud of it. We think we have nothing to envy of the other two bids."" Copyright 2011 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Fallen IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn left jail on bail on Friday and was whisked to a safe house off Wall Street where he will be held under round-the-clock armed guard. French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde led the race to succeed him in the top job in global finance.

Photographers gathered outside an apartment building in New York's financial district where he was expected. A man held up a placard on which was scribbled ""D.S.K., Not In My Backyard"" -- referring to Strauss-Kahn's initials. Strauss-Kahn, 62, later arrived at another building on Broadway, in the same area, a police source said, to spend a few days before a more permanent home is found for him in the city during potentially long legal proceedings. He will be subject to electronic monitoring around the clock and must wear a tracking device on his ankle. The former French finance minister was once seen as a strong contender to be the next president of France and he played a central role in tackling the global financial crisis of 2007-09. He denies the charges and has vowed to prove his innocence. He resigned from the International Monetary Fund on Wednesday. Strauss-Kahn's lawyers posted $1 million in bail and a $5 million insurance bond, as ordered by a judge on Thursday. Lagarde was in pole position to take over his job as many of Europe's capitals rallied behind her. She has been praised for her role in tackling the European debt crisis and for her experience, with France this year chairing the Group of 20, in handing the often conflicting economic demands of advanced and developing economies. The IMF has been run by a European ever since it was created at the end of World War Two. The challenge for emerging economies to break Europe's grip on the job got tougher when the most widely tipped potential candidate from among their ranks ruled himself out. German Chancellor Angela Merkel all but endorsed Lagarde, telling a news conference she rated her highly. Chairman of the U.S. law firm Baker & McKenzie in Chicago before joining the French government in 2005, she is a fluent English speaker. She would be the first woman to head the IMF. Diplomats said some European Union countries questioned whether Lagarde could be anointed before a special court decides next month whether she should be investigated in a French legal case. Singapore's Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam, who heads the IMF's key policy-steering panel, said the world body faced pressing challenges and must quickly pick a new head. ""It is also imperative that the process be open, transparent and merit-based, so as to ensure the selection of a highly capable candidate...."" he said in a statement.

163	Maids fear male guests	"Advertisement NEW YORK (AP) — Hotel housekeepers say they often feel a twinge of fear when they slide the keycard, turn the door handle and step into a room to clean it.
” Anthony Roman, a consultant based on New York’s Long Island who spent 30 years working security for hotels, said he saw dozens of incidents involving female room attendants, from drunken propositions to rape.
Rico, a 38-year-old housekeeper at a hotel in Irvine, Calif."	"Advertisement NEW YORK (AP) — Hotel housekeepers say they often feel a twinge of fear when they slide the keycard, turn the door handle and step into a room to clean it. What will they find? For Argelia Rico, it was a naked man who touched himself as he ogled her. For Kimberly Phillips, it was a pair of dogs that tore into her leg. The former head of the powerful International Monetary Fund, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, was charged last week with chasing a housekeeper around his $3,000 a night penthouse suite and forcing her to perform oral sex on him at the Sofitel New York hotel. But labor groups and hotel housekeepers have reported at least 10 other attacks in the United States in recent years, from the Washington, D.C. suburb of Gaithersburg, Md., to remote Grand Island, Neb. Labor groups say many more are hushed up because the victims are illegal immigrants or because hotels are wary of scaring off guests. Many hotels laid off security staff during the recession, leaving workers even more vulnerable, they said. “It’s dangerous work,” said Yazmin Vazquez, who works at a hotel in downtown Chicago. “These customers think they can use us for anything they want because we don’t have the power that they have or the money that they have.” Anthony Roman, a consultant based on New York’s Long Island who spent 30 years working security for hotels, said he saw dozens of incidents involving female room attendants, from drunken propositions to rape. “They’re not an infrequent occurrence,” he said. Roman said that although hotels try to make sure that housekeepers aren’t alone for their whole shift, “if you have a sexual predator by nature, all bets are off.” At the luxury hotel in Toronto where Andria Babbington worked for 17 years, housekeepers especially hated doing “turn-down” service, which involves preparing beds for the night. Some men would put money on the pillow, ask for sexual favors and tell the women they could take the money when they left, Babbington said. Others took a more circuitous route to the same end: They would inquire about a housekeeper’s home country and how many family members she was supporting. Then came some sympathetic-sounding questions about much the hotel paid them — followed by an offer of money for sex. One guest bugged Babbington for days about having a threesome with his wife. She hid her nametag whenever she cleaned his room. If a housekeeper reacted angrily, the guest would find some reason to raise a stink, she said. “When they complained the management would send a fruit basket up to their room and offer them a discount on their next stay,” Babbington said. “It became the norm, and we couldn’t do anything about it.” Now a union organizer, the 45-year-old Babbington said she now hears similar stories from workers at other hotels. Rico, a 38-year-old housekeeper at a hotel in Irvine, Calif., said she was cleaning a bathroom in 2009 when a guest entered and asked her to change his sheets. She did, then went to get her cleaning supplies out of the bathroom. When she came out he was lying naked on the bed, watching her and touching himself, she said. “When I told my supervisors, they didn’t do anything,” Rico said. “From then on I had to ask a co-worker from the floor upstairs to accompany me so I could clean his room, because that really scared me.” Phillips was cleaning rooms at a Hampton Inn in Lebanon, Ky., last year when she opened the door of Room 118 to find two dogs. The animals attacked her left leg, biting through to the bone, until a hotel guest fought them off with Phillips’ broom. The dogs belonged to a contractor who was staying at the hotel while doing work there. The 40-year-old Phillips now uses a cane and walks with a limp. She has nerve damage in her leg and suffers from panic attacks. “It’s completely changed my whole life,” she said. “Even to sit outside, I can’t do that: I’m afraid a dog is going to approach me.” The Hampton Inn’s manager, Becky Edlin, said the hotel had tightened its security measures after the attack but declined to elaborate. Many hotels have adopted policies aimed at protecting housekeepers, such as barring them from cleaning rooms while they are occupied. One standard practice is to prop the open door with a supply cart. Vazquez, 40, says she started wearing extra clothes under her uniform as an added layer of protection after a VIP guest barged into a bathroom she was cleaning and pulled out his privates in August. She also wears a jacket that comes down to her thighs. Some hotels will send only male employees to a room late at night if their computers show a guest is watching porn, said Carl Boger, dean of academics at the University of Houston’s college of hotel management.

In court papers filed by his defense team Wednesday, Strauss-Kahn said he had surrendered his passport and wouldn't flee the country.
The woman's lawyer, Jeffrey Shapiro, has dismissed suggestions from some of Strauss-Kahn's defenders that she made up the charges or tried to cover up a consensual encounter."	"IMF chief resigns, will make new bid for bail By TOM HAYS and COLLEEN LONG Associated Press Published: Thursday, May 19, 2011 at 5:12 a.m. Last Modified: Thursday, May 19, 2011 at 5:12 a.m. NEW YORK - Hours after Dominique Strauss-Kahn resigned from his post as manager of the International Monetary Fund - saying he felt compelled to focus his energy on the sexual assault charges he faces - the French politician will try to get out of jail. Behind bars on New York's Rikers Island since Monday, the beleaguered former IMF chief is scheduled to return to a Manhattan court Thursday afternoon to again ask for bail on charges he sexually assaulted a hotel maid - a move seemed certain to face vigorous opposition by prosecutors. Late Wednesday, Strauss-Kahn resigned as managing director of the International Monetary Fund, according to a letter released by its executive board. In the letter, Strauss-Kahn denied the allegations but said he felt compelled to resign with ""great sadness"" because he was thinking of his family and also wanted to protect the IMF. In court papers filed by his defense team Wednesday, Strauss-Kahn said he had surrendered his passport and wouldn't flee the country. His attorneys proposed posting $1 million cash bail and confining him to the home of his daughter, Camille, a Columbia University graduate student, 24 hours a day with electronic monitoring. Strauss-Kahn, 62, ""is a loving husband and father, and a highly regarded diplomat, politician, lawyer, politician, economist and professor, with no criminal record,"" his attorneys wrote. They had proposed similar conditions at an earlier bail hearing but added the promise of house arrest Wednesday. A judge denied him bail Monday. Investigators have revisited to the penthouse hotel room to cut out a piece of carpet in a painstaking search for DNA evidence, law enforcement officials said Wednesday. New York detectives and prosecutors believe the carpet in the hotel room may contain Strauss-Kahn's semen, spat out after an episode of forced oral sex, the officials told The Associated Press. One of the officials said that the DNA testing was being ""fast-tracked"" but that the results could still be a few days away. The two officials spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because neither was authorized to speak about the case publicly and because it has gone to a grand jury. The maid, a 32-year-old immigrant from the West African nation of Guinea, told police that Strauss-Kahn came out of the bathroom naked, chased her down, forced her to perform oral sex on him and tried to remove her underwear before she broke free and fled the room. The AP does not identify alleged victims of sex crimes unless they agree to it. Strauss-Kahn went from his $3,000-a-night hotel suite to an isolated cell block at Rikers normally reserved for patients with contagious diseases. Kept in protective custody and on a suicide watch, authorities said he ate his meals alone in a single cell and was escorted everywhere by prison guards. Defense lawyers can raise the issue of bail as many times as they like, and it's common to make new proposals and try again after a client gets high or no bail, said Stuart P. Slotnick, a New York defense lawyer not involved in the case. Such attempts can succeed if a judge is persuaded that new information reduces the perceived risk that the person won't come back to court if released. Living elsewhere is often seen as raising that risk, but it's not insurmountable, Slotnick said. In a case like Strauss-Kahn's, bail ""is not going to be a slam dunk, but if they can convince the judge that he's not a risk of flight, that he's going to come back, then he'll get bail,"" Slotnick said. Manhattan prosecutors didn't immediately comment on the new bail motion. Another hearing had been scheduled for Friday, the deadline for prosecutors to bring an indictment, agree to a preliminary hearing or release him. In addition to examining the Sofitel Hotel suite for further potential DNA evidence, investigators were looking at the maid's keycard to determine whether she used it to enter the room, and how long she was there, officials said. Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly declined to comment Wednesday on the details of the evidence-gathering but said results of any DNA and other testing have not yet come back. He said the detectives investigating the case found the maid's story believable. ""Obviously, the credibility of the complainant is a factor in cases of this nature,"" Kelly said. ""One of the things they're trained to look for, and what was reported to me early on, was that the complainant was credible."" One of Strauss-Kahn's attorneys, Benjamin Brafman, said at his client's arraignment this week that the forensic evidence ""will not be consistent with a forcible encounter."" That led to speculation the defense would argue it was consensual sex. The woman's lawyer, Jeffrey Shapiro, has dismissed suggestions from some of Strauss-Kahn's defenders that she made up the charges or tried to cover up a consensual encounter. Strauss-Kahn is one of France's highest-profile politicians and was seen as a potential candidate for president in next year's elections. His arrest shocked France. The scandal comes at a critical moment for the International Monetary Fund, which is trying to shore up teetering economies in Europe. The IMF is an immensely powerful agency that loans money to countries to stabilize the world economy. In exchange it often imposes strict austerity measures. --- Associated Press writers Jennifer Peltz and Chris Hawley contributed to this report."
166	IMF Chief's 'Perp Walk' Stirs Outrage in France	"Sylfie Vallon el Kadri, a French civil servant, said the images of Strauss-Kahn in court ""were difficult to bear.
Philip J. Dinhofer, the lawyer who argued the case against staged walks, said non-staged walks can provide a public service by showing the public who was caught so other potential victims can come forward.
He questioned whether the public treatment Strauss-Kahn faces is any different from the embarrassment former California Gov."	"(null) A sea of cameras captured a rumpled, handcuffed, angry-looking Dominique Strauss-Kahn as plainclothes detectives took the International Monetary Fund head from a police precinct to court. The images weren't unusual for a high-profile criminal case in the U.S., but in his French homeland, they'd be illegal. While American authorities have condoned, or at least tolerated, such ""perp walks"" for more than a century, in France it's been illegal to show images of suspects in handcuffs since 2000. French politicians and citizens alike are upset by the images, which they say make Strauss-Kahn, accused of sexual abuse, appear guilty. ""DSK Handcuffed: Photo Shock,"" read a headline in Tuesday's daily Le Parisien. ""Dominique still is presumed innocent,"" said Martine Aubry, head of France's Socialist party, which had been expected to make Strauss-Kahn its nominee to challenge President Nicolas Sarkozy in next year's election. Sylfie Vallon el Kadri, a French civil servant, said the images of Strauss-Kahn in court ""were difficult to bear."" ""It was very humiliating for him whatever the results of the investigation are,"" she said. ""Whether he is guilty or not, his image is certainly tarnished. His political career has just stopped abruptly."" In the United States, and especially in New York, criminal suspects are literally walked out of police precincts with officers to face charges in court. Celebrities including Johnny Depp and Russell Crowe, professional athletes, politicians and average Joes arrested for headline-grabbing crimes in New York have all received such treatment. In Dallas, Lee Harvey Oswald was being walked when he was shot in 1963, the iconic image captured by hungry photographers. ""I think it is humiliating,"" New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said of the practice. ""But, you know, if you don't want do the perp walk, don't do the crime."" Bloomberg quickly corrected himself, noting that suspects are innocent until proven guilty. Strauss-Kahn made his perp walk in the early-morning hours Sunday as he left a Harlem precinct to face charges of attempted rape and sexual abuse in a suspected attack on a hotel maid. Photographers waited hours outside the station house for him to emerge. Later, photos captured a scruffy Strauss-Kahn inside a Manhattan courtroom. The New York Police Department doesn't make a practice of letting reporters know when a suspect is going to leave a precinct, but they also don't go to special lengths to sneak someone out when cameras are waiting outside. The department does not release mug shots. ""These aren't scheduled events,"" said chief spokesman Paul Browne. Whether quietly tipped off by police eager to show off good detective work, or just employing savvy beat reporters, the media somehow always seem to know where the suspect is going to be, and there's no law prohibiting the practice. ""The media is relentless. They'll follow police cars, and hang out of trees. They do whatever they have to do to get a picture,"" said Al Primo, a TV consultant who came up with the ABC ""Eyewitness News"" idea. A lawsuit in the late 1990s challenged what was known as the ""staged"" walk, where police sometimes paraded the suspect outside for no other reason than so media could take pictures. A judge ruled that staged walks violated the suspect's Fourth Amendment rights, but in 2003 a U.S. appeals court found that non-staged perp walks were constitutional. Defense attorneys say the images can be hard to counter, and can sometimes poison a jury pool, but they generally tolerate the practice as a necessary evil. Philip J. Dinhofer, the lawyer who argued the case against staged walks, said non-staged walks can provide a public service by showing the public who was caught so other potential victims can come forward. He said they also can help calm the public after arrests are made for high-profile violent crimes. He questioned whether the public treatment Strauss-Kahn faces is any different from the embarrassment former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger is going through after his public admission that he fathered a child with another woman. ""The public exacts a high price from its political leaders to be beyond reproach on public and ethical grounds,"" he said. ""Sometimes you stick your neck out into the public realm and it gets cut off."" The practice varies around the world -- in Japan, for instance, police generally cover suspects' faces with jackets or scarves whenever they might be caught on film. Some other countries, however, make the U.S. approach look tame. In Mexico, suspects are paraded in front of cameras handcuffed, bruised and often bloodied. Several countries in Southeast Asia parade suspects accused of drug crimes in front of journalists at news conferences and pile any seized contraband on a table in front of the accused. For violent crimes, Thailand goes a step further, forcing some suspects whom police say have confessed to re-enact their alleged crimes in front of journalists and family members of victims. The stagings can be gruesome -- one included the corpse of a murdered child -- and they have occasionally incited lynch mobs. Not every prominent U.S. suspect gets a perp walk, though the reasons some authorities avoid them aren't necessarily related to the rights of the accused. In Los Angeles, for instance, it's common for celebrities to be shuttled to and from court using hidden routes, in large part because the media crush can be so overwhelming that police consider a perp walk to be a potential safety hazard. Even so, photographers in Southern California have often been able to get shots of big-name suspects such as O.J. Simpson and Michael Jackson in handcuffs. Dr. Conrad Murray, who is accused of manslaughter in Jackson's death, managed to avoid handcuffs when he was arrested last year after his attorneys argued with authorities over the terms of his surrender. In New York, law enforcement would likely have been accused of giving the French suspect special treatment had he been spirited away secretly. New York Jets lineman Mark Gastineau, Al Sharpton and Son of Sam David Berkowitz were all walked in front of cameras. So were David Lee Roth, Tupac Shakur, Carlo Gambino and John Gotti. According to police historian Thomas Reppetto, in 1903, the NYPD once paraded a bunch of arrested Mafia suspects through the streets of Little Italy. The department said it was because it couldn't get the horse-drawn wagons to come. But really police wanted to show the mob they were in charge -- and they made the press happy, too, Reppetto said. ""An arrest is a public event,"" he said.

167	Germany &#39;respects&#39; <em>Strauss-Kahn</em> resignation	"Germany 'respects' Strauss-Kahn resignation (AFP) – 4 hours ago BERLIN — Germany said Thursday it respected Dominique Strauss-Kahn's decision to quit as head of the International Monetary Fund, with Chancellor Angela Merkel calling for a successor to be named soon.
This step will restore quickly the IMF's full operational capacity.
Merkel reiterated on Thursday that given the IMF's ""strong involvement"" in the eurozone debt crisis, Berlin wanted to see Strauss-Kahn replaced by a European, and for there to be a swift decision on his successor."	"Germany 'respects' Strauss-Kahn resignation (AFP) – 4 hours ago BERLIN — Germany said Thursday it respected Dominique Strauss-Kahn's decision to quit as head of the International Monetary Fund, with Chancellor Angela Merkel calling for a successor to be named soon. ""The government respects the decision ... This step will restore quickly the IMF's full operational capacity. Dominique Strauss-Kahn did valuable work for the IMF during a difficult economic period,"" a spokesman said in a statement. Strauss-Kahn, 62, resigned late on Wednesday, four days after being arrested in New York on suspicion of sexually assaulting and attempting to rape a 32-year-old chamber maid in his luxury hotel suite. Merkel reiterated on Thursday that given the IMF's ""strong involvement"" in the eurozone debt crisis, Berlin wanted to see Strauss-Kahn replaced by a European, and for there to be a swift decision on his successor. ""I am of the opinion that we should propose a European candidate ... I will name no names today but we will discuss it within the European Union,"" Merkel told reporters. ""I believe it is of great importance also that we find a solution quickly, of course."" She added: ""Of course developing nations are within their rights in the medium term to occupy the post of either IMF head of World Bank chief. ""But I think that in the current situation, with serious problems with the euro and the IMF strongly involved, there is a lot in favour of a European candidate being put forward."" Merkel said that the fact that Strauss-Kahn's term of office had not yet ended -- it had been due to end in November 2012 -- should also ""be taken into account"" and put forward as an argument for having another European. She did not specify if she thought a European should only take over until November 2012. Her deputy spokesman Christoph Steegmans had said on Wednesday that there was ""a whole range of highly qualified candidates"" within Europe. Christine Lagarde, French finance minister, and Axel Weber, until recently the chairman of the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, have been touted as possible front-runners for the job. The IMF has contributed billions of euros (dollars) to European bailouts of debt-ridden eurozone members Greece, Ireland and Portugal. Strauss-Kahn, a former Socialist finance minister who had been widely expected to challenge Nicolas Sarkozy for the French presidency in elections next year, is currently in custody and has protested his innocence. Later on Thursday his lawyers planned to go to court to seek bail, backed by the offer of a million-dollar bond and a promise that Strauss-Kahn will remain in a New York apartment.

168	"Dominique Strauss-Kahn Put on House Arrest, as IMF Eyes Replacement"	"Dominique Strauss-Kahn, former Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), who resigned Wednesday after being arrested on allegations that he attempted to sexually assault a chambermaid at Manhattan’s posh Sofitel Hotel, has been released from New York City’s notorious Rikers Island jail on bail Friday afternoon."	"Dominique Strauss-Kahn, former Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), who resigned Wednesday after being arrested on allegations that he attempted to sexually assault a chambermaid at Manhattan’s posh Sofitel Hotel, has been released from New York City’s notorious Rikers Island jail on bail Friday afternoon. Appearing in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, on Thursday, Strauss-Kahn, who was indicted on Wednesday on seven counts of attempted rape and sexual abuse, was released on the condition that he post $1 Million in bail and $5 Million in bond, the latter secured by the mortgaging of his home in Washington, D.C. State Supreme Court Justice Michael J. Obus received the bail and bond from Strauss-Kahn’s legal counsel early Friday, and Obus indicated he was willing to sign off on the bond, but said, ""I just want to be clear no one will be released until all the conditions have been satisfied."" Strauss-Kahn was expected to leave the city jail for an apartment in Manhattan, where he would be staying with his 26-year old daughter (from a previous marriage), Camille Strauss-Kahn, a graduate student of engineering and international development at the Ivy League Columbia University. However, after WNBC (the New York flagship station of the NBC network) released the address of the residence, resulting in a media crush outside the apartment building, other arrangements were made for his release. This attention convinced the jailed bigwig's legal team to bail on that address and find another temporary home for Strauss-Kahn, according to a source close to the defense. The source said they were trying for privacy in the case that drew international attention — and added that the change in address shouldn't delay his Friday release. An apartment at the exclusive Bristol Plaza apartments on Manhattan’s Upper East Side had initially been rented for him, but he was turned away by the management due to liability concerns. Either way, Strauss-Kahn's new home will come with armed guards monitoring his every move around the clock, and the embattled multi-millionaire will be fully paying for all costs associated with his house arrest, including security fees of up to $200,000 per month to retain a prison-like scrutiny before he is sentenced. At least one of the guards will be armed at all times, and Strauss-Kahn will also wear an electronic bracelet — dubbed a ""personal tracking unit"" — on his ankle. Arrested on Sunday night, after being pulled off of an Air France flight ready for take off at New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport by NYPD officers, Strauss-Kahn was held almost five days behind bars and was not immediately granted a bail hearing because he had been kept in protective custody and on a suicide watch. On Thursday, defense lawyer William W. Taylor called the bail decision ""a great relief for the family"" and said Strauss-Kahn's mindset was ""much better now than before we started."" Taylor had argued in court ""that the prospect of Mr. Strauss-Kahn teleporting himself to France and living there as an accused sex offender, fugitive, is ludicrous on its face.“ “He is an honorable man,"" Taylor told the judge. ""He will appear in this court and anywhere else the court directs. He has only one interest at this time and that is to clear his name."" A different judge had ordered Strauss-Kahn be held without bail Monday; his lawyers subsequently added home confinement to their bail proposal. His wife, the French television journalist Anne Sinclair, has rented a Manhattan apartment for the couple, Taylor said. Meanwhile, a French woman considering filing a complaint against Strauss-Kahn over an alleged 2002 sexual assault does not want to testify in the attempted rape case against him, her lawyer said. In France, lawyer David Koubbi told Reuters on Friday that his client, writer Tristane Banon, would refuse to talk to U.S. investigators. ""The presumption of innocence does not exist in the United States. My client does not want her strategy included in that framework,"" Koubbi said. French media did not pay much attention to the Banon case when an account of it first surfaced in 2007, but have returned to the matter, which was never the subject of a formal legal complaint, since Strauss-Kahn's arrest in New York. Under French law, sexual assault charges must be filed within three years, but attempted rape charges have a broader statue of limitations, and can be brought up to 10 years after the alleged attack. Many other women have come forward since Strauss-Kahn’s arrest, alleging that they, too, have not only been victimized by Strauss-Kahn, but have also been victimized by what they perceive as a culture of institutional sexual harassment at multiple levels within I.M.F. leadership. News of Strauss-Kahn being placed under house arrest on Friday was also accompanied by announcements that the IMF shareholders committee is looking at potential replacements for I. M. F. Managing Director. U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said on Friday that discussions were under way with IMF shareholders from emerging markets as well as advanced countries about a new IMF chief. Geithner also said that the United States will support a candidate to succeed Dominique Strauss-Kahn at the helm of the IMF who can command broad support at the institution. ""We are prepared to support a candidate with the requisite, deep experience and leadership qualities, and who can command broad support among the Fund’s membership,"" Geithner said in a statement. ""It is important that this be an open process and one that moves quickly to select new leadership for the IMF."" Geithner said that U.S. officials were consulting ""broadly"" with the International Monetary Fund's shareholders, ""from emerging markets, as well as advanced economies."" Under a gentleman's agreement, a European has held the post since 1946 and an American has been the president of the IMF's sister institution, the World Bank. French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde was emerging Friday as Europe's choice as the battle raged between advanced and emerging economic powers over who should be the next managing director. Lagarde is ""practically a shoo-in"" as the European Union's candidate to succeed Dominique Strauss-Kahn as IMF managing director, an EU source said Friday. Seven EU directors hold 31.5 percent of the IMF votes on the board, while the United States is by far the largest stakeholder, with nearly 17 percent of the vote. While Strauss-Kahn’s replacement is currently being sought, the IMF also announced Friday that he will receive a one-off severance payment of $250,000, but receive far less in future years from pension and related payments. ""Former Managing Director Strauss-Kahn's annual pension and related entitlements have been grossly over-estimated in media reports this week, and appear based erroneously on a one-off separation payment of $250,000,"" the IMF said in a statement. ""The annual payments would be far, far less than that amount in subsequent years,"" the statement said. Under the terms of his employment, Strauss-Kahn is due both a severance payment, as well as pension payments and an annual ""supplemental"" retirement allowance that would be reduced if he were to draw income from ""regular and continuous employment."" Dominique Strauss-Kahn will be formally answering charges on June 6, when he will be appearing in Manhattan Supreme Court.

170	Dominique Strauss-Kahn: I Will Be Exonerated	"In his first known comments since being arrested for an alleged attack on a maid, Dominique Strauss-Kahn defiantly denied the charges and said his name will be cleared.
""Housekeepers at hotels have a right not to be sexually attacked,"" said Lancman Sunday outside the Sofitel on W. 44th St. ""We send hotel workers into rooms.
A Holiday Inn SoHo maid said she uses her supply cart to prop open the room door to feel safe."	"In his first known comments since being arrested for an alleged attack on a maid, Dominique Strauss-Kahn defiantly denied the charges and said his name will be cleared. (dsk frown.jpg) Our Lukas I. Alpert reports: ""I deny in the strongest possible terms the allegations which I now face,"" the former-IMF chief said in a farewell e-mail to his staff. ""I am confident that the truth will come out and I will be exonerated."" The e-mail - obtained by CNN - was forwarded to the entire staff of the International Monetary Fund Sunday evening by its acting head John Lipsky. Strauss-Kahn said the decision to step down from the global economic policy group was made with ""profound sadness"" and frustration, but he was anxious to spare the institution. ""I cannot accept that the fund - and you dear colleagues - should in any way have to share my own personal nightmare. So I had to go,"" he wrote. Strauss-Kahn, 62, was arrested May 14 on charges he tried to rape a chambermaid at a Big Apple hotel. He resigned from the IMF last week while still in jail. He was placed under house arrest by a judge on Friday and is confined to a lower Manhattan apartment. Strauss-Kahn - who was a top contender to be France's next president - had run the IMF since 2007. ""What the institution has achieved in the last three and a half years is the fruit of your thinking, your work, your conviction,"" he said. ""Thank you, good luck for the future and au revoir."" Strauss-Kahn's long-suffering heiress wife, Anne Sinclair, put down $1 million to bail her husband out and will have to pony up at least $200,000-a-month to cover security costs his court-ordered home confinement. Meanwhile, as our Simone Weichselbaum reports, New York's hotel maids would be fitted with panic buttons under a bill prompted by Strauss-Kahn's arrest on charges of attacking a Sofitel housekeeper. (lancman presser.jpg) The legislation, which Assemblyman Rory Lancman (D-Queens) plans to introduce Monday, calls for maids to carry alarms with small buttons that look like key chains and can alert security to peril. ""Housekeepers at hotels have a right not to be sexually attacked,"" said Lancman Sunday outside the Sofitel on W. 44th St. ""We send hotel workers into rooms. By themselves. With no security."" Lancman said the incident last Saturday, when a 32-year-old Sofitel maid told cops that the French fat cat forced her to perform oral sex and tried to rape her, inspired the bill. Housekeepers applauded the proposed law, saying predatory guests are common. Workers at the Hilton New York on Sixth Ave. said a 19th-floor maid hid from a naked tourist Wednesday after he chased her screaming, ""I need sex! I need sex!"" as she tried to tidy up his room. ""I just ran away and went into another room and locked the door,"" she told the Daily News. ""I told my supervisor. She came back to the room with me to clean it. I didn't want to be alone,"" she said. The woman said she didn't report it to hotel security because the man checked out later that day. A Holiday Inn SoHo maid said she uses her supply cart to prop open the room door to feel safe. ""There is no time to call security. There is no time to use the phone,"" she said. ""You just have to run."" A housekeeper at the Millenium Hilton said she once caught a male guest masturbating and now eyes the room's mirrors before going inside. ""If there is a man in the room and he asks for service, I put my vacuum in the door. I never ever close the door. Ever,"" she said. Share"
171	Strauss-Kahn set for release from NYC prison	"(AP) NEW YORK - Lawyers arguing whether ex-IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn should get out of jail while he awaits trial on attempted rape charges have used two famous examples from different sides of the spectrum to make their case — Roman Polanski and Bernard Madoff.
The 62-year-old French economist and diplomat briefly wore an expression of relief after state Supreme Court Justice Michael J. Obus announced his decision in a packed courtroom."	"(AP) NEW YORK - Lawyers arguing whether ex-IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn should get out of jail while he awaits trial on attempted rape charges have used two famous examples from different sides of the spectrum to make their case — Roman Polanski and Bernard Madoff. Prosecutors brought up Polanski, the French filmmaker whom U.S. authorities pursued for decades after he jumped bail in a 1977 child sex case. Defense lawyers have mentioned Bernard Madoff, the financier who was freed on high bail and strict house arrest, the same conditions that a judge approved Thursday in a bail package for Strauss-Kahn. The onetime potential French presidential contender is charged with sexually attacking a New York City hotel maid. He denies the allegations. After Strauss-Kahn spent nearly a week in police custody and then jail, the judge agreed to free him on $1 million cash bail plus an additional $5 million bond — provided he's confined to a New York apartment, under armed guard and electronic monitoring. He wasn't immediately released from the city's bleak Rikers Island jail, where he had been kept in protective custody and on a suicide watch. But his lawyers expect he'll get out Friday, after he posts the bond and authorities review the security arrangements involved in his house arrest. The 62-year-old French economist and diplomat briefly wore an expression of relief after state Supreme Court Justice Michael J. Obus announced his decision in a packed courtroom. Later, Strauss-Kahn blew a kiss toward his wife. Strauss-Kahn didn't speak during the court proceeding. But as he headed back to jail for what he hoped would be a final night, lawyer William W. Taylor called the bail decision ""a great relief for the family"" and said Strauss-Kahn's mindset was ""much better now than before we started."" The ex-IMF head is accused of attacking a 32-year-old housekeeper Saturday in his $3,000-a-night hotel suite. The West African immigrant told police he chased her down a hallway in the suite, forced her to perform oral sex and tried to remove her stockings. ""The proof against him is substantial. It is continuing to grow every day as the investigation continues,"" Manhattan assistant district attorney John ""Artie"" McConnell told the judge Thursday as prosecutors announced that Strauss-Kahn had been indicted on charges including attempted rape and a criminal sex act. The indictment, a crucial procedural step in a felony case, marked a grand jury's ""determination that the evidence supports the commission of non-consensual, forced sexual acts,"" District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. said. Strauss-Kahn, whose lawyers have suggested evidence won't support a forcible encounter, is due back in court June 6. The bail decision came less than a day after Strauss-Kahn resigned as managing director of the IMF, the powerful organization that makes emergency loans to countries in financial crisis. In his resignation letter, he denied the allegations against him but said he would quit in order to ""protect this institution which I have served with honor and devotion"" and to ""devote all my strength, all my time and all my energy to proving my innocence."" Prosecutors had argued against his release, citing the violent nature of the alleged offenses and saying his wealth and international connections would make it easy for him to flee. At his arraignment Monday, a prosecutor suggested that if Strauss-Kahn were released and ran, he could end up ""just like Roman Polanski,"" whom the Swiss government declined to extradite last year in the child sex case in the U.S. in which he had jumped bail decades ago. On Thursday, defense lawyers offered a notorious example of their own: Madoff, the fraudulent financier who stole billions of dollars from investors. Before Madoff pleaded guilty in the federal case and was sentenced to 150 years in prison in 2009, he was freed on $10 million bail, under house arrest and private guard provided by the same firm Strauss-Kahn's lawyers have proposed to monitor him. Taylor cited Madoff as he noted in court that ""there have been other high-profile cases where (defendants) have been released."" Taylor called the proposed arrangement ""the most restrictive possible conditions,"" although he suggested few precautions were necessary. ""In our view, no bail is required to confirm Mr. Strauss-Kahn's appearance. He is an honorable man. He will appear in this court and anywhere else the court directs, and he has only one interest at this time, and that is to clear his name,"" Taylor said. A different judge had ordered Strauss-Kahn held without bail Monday; his lawyers subsequently added home confinement to their bail proposal. His wife, the French television journalist Anne Sinclair, has rented a Manhattan apartment for the couple, Taylor said. Supreme Court Justice Michael J. Obus said the conditions played a major role in his decision to allow bail, but he warned Strauss-Kahn he might reconsider ""if there is the slightest problem with your compliance."" Strauss-Kahn nodded in response. Dressed in a gray suit and an open-necked blue dress shirt, he had arrived stony-faced, though he turned to give a quick smile to his wife and daughter Camille, seated in the audience along with about 100 reporters. They and other journalists, lining a sidewalk below, formed the biggest media throng at the courthouse at least since Mark David Chapman was arrested in 1980 for killing John Lennon, court spokesman David Bookstaver said. In France, a Socialist lawmaker and longtime Strauss-Kahn ally, Francois Pupponi, expressed relief at the decision to allow the former finance minister to leave jail. ""There's finally a bit of good news in a terrible week,"" he said on BFM-TV. ""We were no longer expecting good news."" The political wrangling over who will succeed Strauss-Kahn at the IMF already has begun. European officials, including Germany's chancellor, the European Commission and France's finance minister, have argued that his replacement should be a European. Some authorities from China and Brazil have said it is time to break Europe's traditional dominance over the position and appoint someone from a developing nation. U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has asked for an ""open process,"" without mentioning specific candidates."

The US Treasury Secretary has called for his replacement Dominique Strauss-Kahn is ""not in a position to run"" the International Monetary Fund after his arrest over an alleged sexual assault, US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has said. Mr Geithner said the IMF's executive board should designate an interim head.The alleged assault on a maid happened at New York's luxury Sofitel hotel on 14 May. Mr Strauss-Kahn - who denies the claims - has been put on suicide watch in the city's infamous Rikers Island prison. As a precaution, guards are required to check on him every 15 to 30 minutes. 'Honest woman' The 62-year-old, who had been seen as a favourite in France's 2012 presidential elections, faces seven charges and could be sentenced to up to 25 years in jail. The defense offered to post $1m bail, with Mr Strauss-Kahn to stay at his daughter's address in New York until the next hearing on Friday. However, a New York judge rejected the application. The lawyer for Mr Strauss-Kahn's alleged victim says his client, a 32-year-old hotel maid, is living through an ""extraordinary"" trauma and is now in hiding. ""It's not just my opinion that this woman is honest,"" Jeffrey Shapiro said. "" The New York City Police Department (NYPD) reached the same conclusion. This is a woman with no agenda.""It's not just my opinion that this woman is honest. The New York City Police Department reached the same conclusion.” Addressing the Harvard Club in New York on Tuesday, Mr Geithner said the most important thing for the IMF was that it found a leader to fill Mr Strauss-Kahn's shoes .""He is obviously not in a position to run the IMF,"" Mr Geithner said. ""It is important that the board of the IMF formally put in place for an interim period someone to act as managing director.""It is the first time that a top official from President Barack Obama's administration has publicly spoken about the impact of Mr Strauss-Kahn's alleged sexual assault. However, Mr Geithner refused to comment on the case or the details of the charges against Mr Strauss-Kahn.Since Mr Strauss-Kahn's arrest last Saturday, his deputy John Lipsky has been serving as acting managing director of the global lending agency. Mr Geithner refused to be drawn on the legal challenges facing Mr Strauss-Kahn Washington has a major say in determining who runs the IMF, because it has the largest number of votes in the organisation. Earlier, Austrian Finance Minister Maria Fekter said Mr Strauss-Kahn was ""hurting"" the organisation."

He is the author and editor of several books in French history, and author of the forthcoming ""The Statue of Liberty, a Transatlantic History."" While some French women may be more forgiving than their American counterparts, the Strauss-Kahn case doesn’t mean that Parisiennes tolerate cheating, harassment, and even rape. Their reticence to speak about these things comes from the French media, which has long considered the sexual misconduct of alpha-men beyond the journalistic pale. To understand this Gallic media 'discretion,' rewind to the days of J.F.K. Any woman who dares to go public with accounts of sexual harassment, and worse, will be greeted with media indifference. If she persists, she’ll find the accusations turned back against her. So why make waves? The best way for Americans to understand this Gallic editorial ""discretion"" is to rewind to the days of J.F.K. In the ‘50s and ‘60s, Washington reporters knew that young women paraded in and out of Kennedy’s quarters at night; they just didn’t write about it. The same is still true of French journalists, who consider the sexual escapades of prominent men off-limits to their audience — even when ""seduction"" shades into violence.

"The week began with concerns on the international front. International Monetary Fund (IMF) managing Director, and potential French presidential candidate, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, was arrested over the weekend on charges of sexual battery and resigned a few days later. The change in leaderships at the IMF (and potential struggle to select a new #1) adds to the uncertainty about Europe’s debt crisis and the news added to the recent volatility in the financial markets. The minutes of the April 26-27 FOMC meeting had a slightly hawkish tilt. The minutes showed that “a majority of participants now judged the inflation risks as weighted to the upside” and “a few members viewed the increase in inflation risks as suggesting that economic conditions might well evolve in a way that would warrant the Committee taking steps toward less-accommodative policy sooner than currently anticipated.” Note that the presidents of all 12 Fed district banks participate at the FOMC meetings, but only five are members of the FOMC and have a vote on monetary policy. The economic data reports were generally on the soft side of expectations, but added little clarity to the overall picture. Residential construction activity weakened in April. Industrial production was flat, supported by an increase in utility output, with factory output down 0.4% due to supply-chain disruptions in the auto industry (a consequence of Japan’s earthquake and tsunami). Ex-autos, manufacturing output rose 0.2%. Homebuilder sentiment remained depressed in May and existing home sales fell in April. The Index of Leading Economic Indicators fell 0.3% in April – one month does not a trend make, but the figure was consistent with some slowing in economic growth in the near term. Next week, once again, the markets could react to any surprises in the data, but the releases aren’t going to add much clarity to the overall economic picture. The estimate of 1Q11 GDP growth is expected to be revised higher. Note that there is typically a high level of noise in new home sales and durable goods orders. The economic calendar will be more meaningful after the Memorial Day holiday.

177	IMF Rape Case: Victim-Bashing Run Amok	"But the same can’t be said for his alleged victim, who has been tried, convicted, sentenced, and pilloried relentlessly in the press and on the web since the moment her accusations went public.
The battle lines over whether he is truly a sexual predator or an innocent victim of a money scam, a set-up, or a politically motivated attack will heat up in the coming days if and when the name and picture of Strauss-Kahn’s alleged victim is “leaked."	"New America Media , Commentary, Earl Ofari Hutchinson, Posted: May 20, 2011 Former International Monetary Fund (IMF) managing director Dominique Strauss-Kahn loudly declared that he did not rape a maid in his hotel room during his stay in New York. Strauss-Kahn is certainly entitled to proclaim his innocence, and under the law he is just that: Innocent until proven guilty. But the same can’t be said for his alleged victim, who has been tried, convicted, sentenced, and pilloried relentlessly in the press and on the web since the moment her accusations went public. There’s no mystery why. From the beginning, there were four things that made the accuser ripe for the race baiting and victim bashing now being carried out by the media, French officials, some African writers and the general public: First, she is a low-wage domestic worker. Second, she is a West African immigrant, whose legal status has been subject to question. Third, she allegedly resided in a Bronx apartment building that caters exclusively to the HIV/AIDS afflicted, inferring that she too is HIV positive. Fourth, and most importantly, she is a black woman. Strauss-Kahn, however, is rich, powerful, politically connected at the highest levels and popular with the French public. His defenders have blithely ignored his checkered history of sexual bad behavior and have dug deep into the apologist bin to claim that he is the victim of an anti-Semitic conspiracy involving everyone from French President Nicolas Sarkozy to unnamed political enemies. Their motive, supposedly, is to derail his bid to become president of France, a post for which he is widely regarded a front-runner. And the conspiracy theory has legs: A recent poll cited by the French public radio service RFI found that nearly 60 percent of those surveyed believe Strauss-Kahn was “set up.” From a purely legal standpoint, none of these things have any relevance to the actual charge of rape. Either Strauss-Kahn did or didn’t commit the act. But it’s never that simple. Race was bound to cast a long shadow over the accusation -- even if Strauss-Kahn’s alleged victim had none of the aforementioned strikes against her, and even if Strauss-Kahn was not a rich, politically powerful figure with a history of sexual improprieties. Women's groups have waged a relentless and often times frustrating fight to get police, prosecutors, courts and the media to treat rape as a serious crime, especially in scenarios where the victims are poor, black or minority women and the alleged attackers are white males. They have endured a long history of gender and race stereotypes that depict black women as sexually loose, available, and crime prone. In decades past, that stereotype made police hesitant to make arrests and prosecutors reluctant to vigorously prosecute rape cases when the victims were black women. This put women, particularly black women, at greater risk of sexual attack, and virtually assured that authorities would turn a blind eye to the perpetrators. Strauss-Kahn, in the not-too-distant past, likely would have benefited from the official blind-eye to a rape charge filed by a black woman. If arrested, he would have quickly posted bail and winged his way back to France. His accuser would have been painted as a gold-digging liar of tainted character. Race would have lurked beneath the character assassination and would have been used in order to make the slur against her believable. This is exactly what’s being done now, even though authorities slapped Strauss-Kahn in a jail cell and initially denied him bail. The battle lines over whether he is truly a sexual predator or an innocent victim of a money scam, a set-up, or a politically motivated attack will heat up in the coming days if and when the name and picture of Strauss-Kahn’s alleged victim is “leaked.” It will be plastered over blogs and websites and the rumor mill will churn overtime, feeding on every tidbit of gossip, allegation, and distorted fact about the alleged victim. She will be retried and re-convicted again in the press. The image assault will be dutifully punctuated with a choice quote from Strauss-Kahn’s attorneys that he is a victim and a target, and that it’s incredulous that a man of his name and prestige, with so much to lose, would stoop to have sex with a maid, and -- unstated but strongly inferred -- a black maid at that. The case and the subsequent trial will continue to stir passions and resentments, and will be yet another object lesson that when the alleged victim is a black female and the accused attacker is a white male, politics, race and passion always collide. The lines will be deliberately blurred over the question of who is the real victim. In this case, for much of the public, it won’t be Strauss-Kahn’s alleged victim.

Across the Atlantic in Manhattan, where the justice system means handcuffs, perp walks and Rikers Island even for one of the world's most powerful men, the New York Daily News page one screamed ""LE PERV"". This was before Strauss-Kahn had even been arraigned before a judge, although after the IMF boss had been charged (a scenario that would be impossible in Australia where the accused, once charged, has the right to a fair trial). Amid the maelstrom that to French supporters of Strauss-Kahn seems a ""surreal"" nightmare of a Philip Roth novel cum reality cable TV show involving charges of attempted rape, a brilliant, sexually voracious Jewish French intellectual and a poor black African immigrant maid, there are now serious claims of a widespread and long-term Paris press cover-up of a serial sexual predator. Or as Christophe Deloire, one of the authors of the 2006 book Sexus Politicus wrote in Le Monde, a ""strange omerta"" has too long existed in the French press corps on the subject of Strauss-Kahn. Deloire says French democracy is in need of an Anglo-Saxon cure a la George Orwell, requiring ""common decency"" and respect for facts, honesty and simplicity on the part of politicians, intellectuals and reporters. Sexus Politicus was the book that broke the taboo surrounding Strauss-Kahn, in a specific chapter that outlined his borderline sexual pressuring of women that went way beyond standard French seduction techniques. The author's use of the word ""omerta"", the Mafia term for the code of silence sworn to by its organised crime family members, is significant. What needs to be examined in the light of the Strauss-Kahn revelations is the broader existence of a cushy and even sinister French media and political environment that has actively shielded male politicians from legitimate scrutiny of personal conduct that may impinge on their public duties. Apart from a societal attitude that sometimes means a Don Juan politician boasting of his conquests (such as Jacques Chirac's admission he was a ""chaud lapin"" or rabbit on heat) is more admired than disapproved of, there is one key explanation for the code of silence. France is a nation where politicians and journalists are literally in bed with one another. This erotically charged conflict of interest could explain what journalist and novelist Tristane Banon, who plans to take legal action against Strauss-Kahn for attempted sexual assault, says is a hushing up of Strauss-Kahn's violent past. The number of politician-journalist couples in France are legion, beginning with the accused himself and his third wife, broadcast journalist Anne Sinclair, who used to interview her future hubby on her excellent evening political program. President Nicolas Sarkozy took Le Figaro political correspondent Anne Fulda as his mistress when his second wife ran off with her lover before leaving him for good. Later he was linked to TF1 network news presenter Laurence Ferrari. The Socialist presidential candidate tipped to run for the Elysee next year in the absence of Strauss-Kahn, Francois Hollande, left Segolene Royal for Valerie Trierweiler, the Paris Match political journalist who covered him in the 2007 election. Such dangerous liaisons are rarely declared until well established, if they are publicised at all. Recently, however, journalist Audrey Pulvar was asked, unusually, to step aside from her TV political chat show when her partner, Socialist Arnaud Montebourg, declared himself a candidate for the presidency. Beyond the compromised couplings, a French reporter commented that French journalists have much reverence for politicians which is ""part laziness, part respect for hierarchy we are a Mediterranean country and part old boys network"". She says the power for change lies with with the most senior staff and media owners who ""are all guys and want to protect one another and feel that powerful men should be left alone"". Of course the French are horrified when a powerful man rapes a poor woman. Contrary to the commentaries of US writers such as Philip Gourevitch in The New Yorker, the National Front's Marine Le Pen is not the only female politician to remind commentators that the accuser's dignity must also be taken into account amid calls for the presumption of innocence for the IMF boss. This is, after all, the country of Simone de Beauvoir and Elisabeth Badinter, where the burka is banned on equality grounds. But France is a proudly sexually liberal country where Roman Polanski counts first lady Carla Bruni and culture minister Frederic Mitterrand (who admitted in a memoir his fondness for ""young boys"" in Thailand) among his supporters. France is also less politically correct on questions of sexual harassment, discrimination and even assault, allowing Levy to put in print what many French would think of the ""opportunistic"" decision of young writer Banon to take legal action now over her claims of attempted forced sex at the hands of Strauss-Kahn in 2002. If indeed Strauss-Kahn is found guilty of attempted rape, however, there will be few defenders left of the great Socialist hope. Without his fatal, and allegedly criminal flaw, he might have become a very good president of France, with a much more reformist and open economic approach than his Socialist colleagues or Nicolas Sarkozy."

"Galvan's Week-Ahead: Sovereign Debt Issues and Dominque Strauss-Kahn This Week in the Markets: A week has been famously described as being a long time in politics, but seemingly in the financial world even a weekend can be transformational. The aftermath of the scandal involving the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, Dominque Strauss-Kahn has put a previously rather obscure institution firmly in the public eye, and of course further plays on the issue and uncertainty surrounding Greece’s second bailout. Although there is no doubt we are now in the middle of PIIGS nation bailout round 2, thus far the Euro hasn’t had the mauling that one might have expected - the fall from $1.49 to $1.41 so far this month notwithstanding. Ironically, in the build up to Greece Crisis MkII, from intense behind the scenes meetings of EU financial ministers running into the Strauss-Kahn arrest, many were suggesting that anything above parity for the Euro versus the U.S. Dollar could be seen as excessive. This view had merit, right up to the point that the financial plight of the U.S. was put into perspective. The revelation that the world’s number one economy is in danger of breaching its $14.3 trillion debt ceiling has thrown up all types of scenarios, from the loss of the U.S. Dollar as reserve currency via soaring commodities prices and of course the kind of default on Treasury Bonds that would make the current situation look like a walk in the park. As the Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner pointed out, the U.S. should ideally get its deficit below 3% of gross domestic product, from 10.9% of GDP currently. The main challenge of course, is how to do this without undermining GDP growth itself. Adding to the general angst has been news that China, the largest holder of T Bonds has reduced its holding in March, although it still remains the top holder. There was rather less drama in the UK, but drama still came, and this time on the inflation front as the latest CPI for April hit 4.5% - a 0.5% rise on the previous month. Presumably the fall in Sterling this week in the wake of the CPI spike was partly due to the contents of the latest letter from the Governor of the Bank of England Mervyn King to Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne. Mervyn blamed high inflation on rises in VAT and commodities / imports prices, but he expects there will be a fall in prices over 2012 / 2013. In the meantime interest rates remain on hold for the good of manufacturing output, and this will apparently remain so whatever level the CPI hits The Week Ahead: May 23rd – 27th Monday – Finals British Land ( LON:BLND ), Mitie Group ( LON:MTO ) Tuesday– Finals Big Yellow Group ( LON:BYG ), Cable & Wireless Worldwide (LON:CW.), De La Rue ( LON:DLAR ), Pennon Group ( LON:PNN ) Interims Paragon Group (LON:PAG). Wednesday – Finals Cable & Wireless Communications ( LON:CWC ), BTG ( LON:BGC ), Telecom Plus (LON:TEP) Interims Britvic ( LON:BVIC ) Thursday– Finals Burberry ( LON:BRBY ), QinetiQ ( LON:QQ. ), United Utilities Group ( LON:UU. ) Interims Daily Mail ( LON:DMGT ) Q1 Antofagasta ( LON:ANTO ) Friday – Finals Electrocomponents ( LON:ECM ), Severn Trent ( LON:SVT ). Although the two companies formerly known as Cable & Wireless split to improve their respective fortunes, the situation has still continued to deteriorate. In share price terms the combined figure is now scraping 100p vs. nearly 150p just before the split, and investors appear as unenthused over the fundamentals as ever. For C&W Worldwide (LON:CW.) the big setback in both share price terms and newsflow came in March as it cut its 2012 earnings guidance. A raft of broker downgrades followed, and now after two profit warnings and the FD’s departure less than 12 months after demerger, the forthcoming finals will have to be very positive indeed to reverse the downward momentum. For fixed line telecoms group Cable & Wireless Communications ( LON:CWC ), the recent past has been somewhat less fraught than its demerged partner. Following the sale of its Bermuda business in February, CWC announced a $100m share buyback, but even so the stock is back where it was at the start of the year, not helped by the RBS hold rating on the company. One of the brighter spots in the retail space since the financial crisis began has been that of the niche players. In this regard luxury accessories group Burberry ( LON:BRBY ) is leading from the front both in terms of growth and it’s entry into the FTSE100. Its main attraction to investors apart from the value of the brand and distinctive chequered pattern has been it’s apparent immunity to the consumer downturn. In fact, it did come down to earth in the Spanish market, but has thrived in emerging economies such as China and Japan. The only real fundamental question mark is whether the earthquake and nuclear accident in Japan will have a lasting impact on one of Burberry’s key markets. Major Economic Data: May 23rd – 27th Monday – EU Flash PMI U.S. Chicago Fed National Activity Index Tuesday –EU German GDP U.S. New Home Sales Wednesday – UK CBI Quarterly Distributive Trades Survey, GDP U.S. Durable Goods, FHFA House Price Index Thursday – UK Retail Sales, CBI Industrial Trends Survey U.S. GDP, Jobless Claims, Fed Balance, Money Supply Friday – UK Nationwide House Price Index EU M3 Money Supply, German CPI U.S. Consumer Sentiment, Pending Home Sales Index GDP is the metric in focus across all leading Western economies this week, with the latest from Germany coming in after a better than expected number for the EU as a whole earlier in the month. In the U.S. there will be updates from the ailing housing market with New Home Sales and the Pending Home Sales Index. Friday will also deliver an update on the UK housing market, on this occasion from Nationwide. In what is a relatively low key week on the economic calendar, it will be Jobless Claims and Durable Goods from the U.S. which will dominate alongside the budget deficit wrangling and of course developing bailout news from Greece which should reach its conclusion. Main Markets Outlook: FTSE100: Currently, the price action of the FTSE100 does seem to be ranging from mysterious to sometimes downright confusing. There is a rangebound consolidation for the index between 5,850 and 5,950, with erratic price action between these points to start May. Of course, the bulls can point to the fact that this activity is taking place well above the rising 200-day moving average – a standard measure of trend. This currently lies at 5,772, and the implication is that at least while above this technical feature on the daily chart, the 2 year uptrend can be adjudged intact even if at the present time it is difficult to see an uptrend higher than the 2011 resistance zone, so far at just over 6,100. Those waiting for a fresh momentum buy signal would probably choose sustained price action back above the recent cap on leading UK stocks, which has been the 50-day moving average now at 5,950. Sterling / Dollar: The irrational U.S. Dollar strength has this month pushed Sterling back towards the $1.60 support zone, plus the currency has also taken a battering from the latest minutes from the Bank of England MPC, with a 6-3 vote against an interest rate rise at the May meeting. While this meeting occurred before the latest shock jump for CPI, it underlined the BoE’s reluctance to raise interest rates anytime soon. Prices will have to be significantly higher than they are now before there is any move back above 0.5%. This leaves the charting position of Sterling looking particularly vulnerable after this week’s three-day failure below the 50-day moving average now running through $1,63. Indeed, while below the 50-day line on an end of day close basis it is difficult to see how this market can avoid a test of the 200-day moving average now running at $1.5924, even though this would take the cross back to February support. Gold: Certainly the consensus and more importantly the reality for the multiyear Gold bull rally should be to buy any dips in this market. Even so, diving in after a $100 retracement does require a degree of application, considering the rapid decline from the initial May peak and all time record at $1,576 to the low point of the month so far at $1,476. And this movement coming in the wake of the death of Bin Laden could actually have resulted in a longer lasting pullback than just a couple of weeks. But the inflationary prospect of another Greece bailout by the EU, the U.S. heading for a debt disaster and speculative interest in physical purchases from India and the Middle East have all kept the metal on track to resume its uptrend. This is likely to remain the case for the rest of this month, especially while there is no end of day close back below the 50 day moving average at $1,473.

"Europe: Obama tends to old allies, new challenges By JULIE PACE and NANCY BENAC Associated Press Published: Sunday, May 22, 2011 at 4:30 a.m. Last Modified: Sunday, May 22, 2011 at 4:11 a.m. Weaving together strands of pomp, policy and summitry, President Barack Obama's weeklong European tour is all about tending to old friends in the Western alliance and securing their help with daunting challenges, from the political upheaval in the Mideast and North Africa to the protracted war in Afghanistan. Obama's eighth trip to Europe as president, with a quick-moving itinerary that dips into four countries in six days, unfolds against the backdrop of the NATO-led bombing campaign in Libya and stubborn economic weakness on both sides of the Atlantic. A priority for the president and his allies will be to more clearly define the West's role in promoting stability and democracy in the Arab world without being overly meddlesome and within tight financial limitations. Obama, who departs late Sunday, will visit Ireland, England, France and Poland. Each is weathering an economic downturn that has forced European nations to adopt strict austerity measures. The U.S. has pushed its national debt to the limit, and Obama and congressional Republicans are in contentious talks about how steeply to cut spending. But never mind all that, at least for a moment. A highlight of Obama's opening stop in Ireland will be a feel-good pilgrimage to the hamlet of Moneygall, where America's first black president will explore his Irish - yes, Irish - roots, and most likely raise a pint. It turns out that Falmouth Kearney, who immigrated to the United States in 1850 at the age of 19, is the great great great grandfather of Obama on his white, Kansas-born mother's side. Obama, whose father was born in Kenya, will connect in Moneygall with distant relatives from the Irish branch of his family tree. Michael Collins, the Irish ambassador to the United States, says the president's visit will be ""a golden moment"" for a country that's been on the economic ropes after its boom time. The visit is sure to play well at home for Obama - make that O'bama - as he heads into re-election season after being pushed to great lengths simply to prove he was born on U.S. soil. After his day in Ireland, Obama spends two in England, where he and first lady Michelle Obama will be treated to all the pomp and pageantry that the monarchy can muster for the president's first European state visit. The Obamas even get a Buckingham Palace sleepover. Though the United States and Britain remain the closest of allies, the relationship has been strained by recent events, including last year's oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico triggered by the explosion of an oil rig owned by British-based BP. Britain's unilateral announcement of a timetable for withdrawal of its 10,000 troops from Afghanistan also rankled the United States. Heather Conley, director of the Europe program at the private Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Obama's stop in Britain could help ""put the `special' back into the U.S.-U.K. special relationship."" Obama on Wednesday will become the first American president to speak to members of Parliament from the historic Palace of Westminster. European leaders are eager to see how president frames the U.S.-European partnership at a time when Obama has prodded Western allies to shoulder greater responsibility in areas such as Afghanistan and Libya. A NATO-led mission is working to protect civilians and assist the rebel fighters trying to oust Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. Former Liberal Democrat leader Menzies Campbell, a member of the House of Commons foreign affairs committee, said British politicians would be listening keenly to what Obama had to say about Afghanistan when he addresses both houses of Parliament on Wednesday. ""The death of Osama bin Laden can only encourage those with the ear of the president to proceed more quickly with the draw-down of American forces in Afghanistan,"" Campbell said. ""MPs and peers alike will be listening closely to what he says about America's intentions for Afghanistan."" In private, Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron will plunge into the details of a host of international challenges on which the U.S. and Britain have worked together: Afghanistan, Libya, counterterrorism, the global economy and more. Both leaders then scoot to a French summit of the Group of Eight industrialized nations, where the president hopes to build on momentum from his speech days ago about how best to promote stability and democracy in the Middle East. Obama has called on the World Bank and International Monetary Fund to present the G-8 with an ambitious plan to help Egypt and Tunisia, in particular, recover from the disruptions caused by their democratic revolutions and prepare for elections later this year. The U.S. and its allies don't want those elections to occur against a backdrop of economic chaos that could increase support for extremists. But there's no expectation of a big aid measure emerging from the G-8. Rather, the countries in the region will present their plans for democratization and stabilizing their economies, and the G-8 will consider ways to help. Although not on the official agenda, the G-8 leaders are sure to be talking about future leadership of the IMF now that former chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn has resigned after being arrested on attempted rape charges in New York. European leaders are anxious to put another European in that position while emerging economies would like to see a process that is open to someone from the developing world. U.S. officials have said they favor an open process, without being more specific. Obama's visit to Europe comes a little more than a month before the U.S. is scheduled to start its gradual troop withdrawal in Afghanistan. The president has said the initial drawdown will be significant, but it's unclear how many specific answers he'll have for European leaders. Britain and France, in particular, are looking for details on the U.S. withdrawal timetable for signs of how NATO will move from combat missions to a training role by the end of 2014. The Afghan mission is deeply unpopular in many European countries, and political pressure has led some leaders to set timetables for their withdrawal. The British are planning to draw down 400 of their nearly 10,000 troops this year, with all British troops out by the end of 2014. France, which has 4,000 troops in Afghanistan, has said it is considering speeding up its withdrawal now that al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden is dead. During his two-day stay in Deauville, France, Obama will take time for one-on-one meetings on the side of the G-8 with several world leaders, including Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan. The U.S.-Russia relationship, though much improved since the Bush administration, remains complex. Medvedev has spoken out strongly in recent weeks against U.S. plans to plant missile interceptors in Romania as part of a U.S. shield over Europe, saying that could threaten Russia. He's warned that Washington's failure to cooperate with Russia on the missile shield could lead to a new arms race, and also threatened to pull out of the New START nuclear treaty with the U.S. if Russia feels at risk. Obama's meeting with Kan would be his first with the Japanese prime minister since the March tsunami and earthquake that triggered a nuclear crisis in Japan. The U.S. has sent military and humanitarian assistance to Japan, as well as nuclear experts, to help the country recover from the disaster. Obama's visit to Poland is emblematic of a growing front in the administration's engagement in Europe, as the U.S. expands its economic and security relationship with Central European nations. Robert Kupiecki, Poland's ambassador to the United States, says Central Europe's experiences in moving toward democracy offer many lessons that are ""directly applicable"" in the Middle East and North Africa, and that Poles and others in the region are anxious to help the democratic movement spread. Lech Walesa, the former Polish president who founded the Solidarity freedom movement, has visited Tunisia, and Walesa will meet with Obama in Poland to talk about the experience. Obama can point to Poland, with its stable government and growing economy, as a benefactor of democracy's virtues."

The woman is an immigrant from the West African nation of Guinea with a 15-year-old daughter, lawyer Jeffrey Shapiro said. Her story of being attacked by Strauss-Kahn in the Sofitel hotel suite near Times Square is ""consistent"" because she is telling the truth, he said. ""There is no way in which there is any aspect of this event which could be construed consensual in any manner,"" Shapiro said. ""This is nothing other than a physical, sexual assault by this man on this young woman."" He continued: ""It's not just my opinion that this woman is honest. The New York City Police Department reached the same conclusion."" He added, ""This is a woman with no agenda."" The 62-year-old Strauss-Kahn is jailed in New York on charges including attempted rape after being denied bail on Monday. Defense attorney Benjamin Brafman has said defense lawyers believe the forensic evidence ""will not be consistent with a forcible encounter."" He wouldn't elaborate but said ""there are significant issues that were already found"" that make it ""quite likely that he will be ultimately be exonerated."" The maid has not been identified, and The Associated Press generally does not name people alleging sexual assault. She arrived seven years ago in the United States from Guinea under ""very difficult circumstances,"" Shapiro said, and lives in the city with her 15-year-old daughter. Shapiro said the woman didn't know that Strauss-Kahn was managing director of the International Monetary Fund and did not know of him in the hotel. ""She did not know who this man was until a day or two after this took place,"" Shapiro said. ""She had no idea who the man was."" The 32-year-old maid told authorities that she thought the suite was empty but that Strauss-Kahn emerged from the bathroom naked, chased her down a hallway, pulled her into a bedroom and dragged her into a bathroom, police said. He grabbed her breasts, tried to pull down her pantyhose, grabbed at her crotch and forced her to perform oral sex, according to a court complaint. She broke free, escaped the room and told hotel staffers what had happened, authorities said. She was treated at a hospital for minor injuries. Other allegations of sexual misbehavior by Strauss-Kahn have begun to circulate since his arrest. A person close to an IMF employee who had a brief affair with Strauss-Kahn said Tuesday that the woman warned the organization about his behavior toward women in a letter sent three years ago. The woman, Hungarian-born economist Piroska Nagy, voiced ""doubts about Dominique Strauss-Kahn's suitability for running an international institution,"" according to the person, who was familiar with the letter's content but declined to be identified, citing the sensitivity of the matter. Nagy, who had worked at the IMF for decades, left the organization after the affair with Strauss-Kahn in 2008. Although the relationship has long been public knowledge, and an IMF-commissioned investigation into the case cleared Strauss-Kahn of wrongdoing, it is back in the news after the 62-year-old Frenchman's incarceration on sex crimes charges in New York. The New York Times published an excerpt of the letter, along with an account that alleged Nagy had been aggressively pursued by her boss, who sent her sexually explicit messages and at one point even had her summoned from the bathroom to speak to him. In France, a lawyer for a 31-year-old novelist said she is likely to file a criminal complaint accusing him of sexually assaulting her nine years ago. A French lawmaker accused him of attacking other maids in previous stays at the same luxury hotel. And in New York, prosecutors said they are working to verify reports of at least one other case, which they suggested was overseas. ___ Associated Press writer Raphael G.

The document emerged as the hotel maid who has accused Strauss-Khan of a vicious sex attack is set to testify in front of a grand jury today."	"BOX: Strauss-Kahn and his many, many womenTristane Banon, 31, journalist Allegation: Attempted rape and sexual assault. Strauss-Kahn allegedly summoned her to a Paris apartment for an interview in 2002 and asked to hold her hand before pouncing on her. He undid her bra and jeans before she shouted 'rape' and kicked him off, she has said. Piroska Nagy, 50, IMF official Allegation: Coerced into a liaison. The Hungarian-born blonde met Strauss-Kahn in Washington in 2007. She says his seniority made her feel pressured into a consensual fling. An investigation cleared him of abusing his authority but he admitted an 'error of judgement'. Aurélie Filippetti, 37, Socialist politician Allegation: Harassment. The leading politician and novelist described a 'very heavy, very insistent' attempt by Strauss-Kahn to chat her up in 2008. She has since denied that he groped her, but said she would 'forever make sure' she was never 'alone in a room with him again'. Yasmina Reza, 51, playwright Allegation: Affair. France's most celebrated dramatist has been romantically linked to Strauss-Kahn as well as his rival Nicolas Sarkozy, after she wrote an intimate account of the president's 2007 campaign. The book was dedicated to 'G', a socialist who is expected to become head of the IMF. Strauss-Kahn's middle name is Gaston. Carmen Llera, 58, writer Allegation: At least one dalliance. The Spanish author was a member of Strauss-Kahn's academic inner circle. In two of her books, she hints at possible affairs with him. Young actress, age unknown Allegation: Gorilla-like behaviour. The unnamed actress was invited to a Paris apartment with Strauss-Kahn, where he allegedly acted like a gorilla or 'randy monkey'. His alleged assault on Tristane Banon also saw him labelled a 'rutting chimpanzee'. European journalist, age unknown Allegation: Harassment. The 'tall and willowy' reporter, using the name Martina, said he called her repeatedly and insisted 'almost directly that I had to sleep with him for an interview'. She did not succumb, but two years later he continued his efforts, when she was pregnant. Mexican chambermaid, age unknown Allegation: Fling According to a book published by a member of Strauss-Kahn's inner circle, he had a fling with a maid in Mexico. If true, the episode echoes the charges he now faces in New York. Officers are required to attach one photograph to the prisoner movement slips, which will then remain with the prisoner until they are transported to court. Strauss-Kahn's state-wide criminal justice system code (NYSID) number is 09132366L. The document emerged as the hotel maid who has accused Strauss-Khan of a vicious sex attack is set to testify in front of a grand jury today. Jeffrey Shapiro, the lawyer acting for the woman, said his client will say 'there was nothing consensual' about the assault that allegedly took place at New York's Sofitel Hotel on Saturday. The line coupled with new physical evidence is thought to be an effort to quash Strauss-Khan's likely line of defence, that the maid did consent to sex. A bail hearing is set to be held for the IMF chief tomorrow, court officials have said. It also emerged today that just one hour after Strauss-Kahn left the Times Square hotel at 12.30pm on Saturday, hotel staff phoned police about the attack. Meanwhile NYPD investigators are DNA-testing samples of fluid they found in the $3,000-a-night suite that Strauss-Khan had been staying in. The maid showed them where she had spat after the Frenchman allegedly forced her to perform oral sex, according to CBS News. Police also say they have checked information from the suite door's electronic card reader which indicates the woman came into the room but didn't shut the door, as is hotel policy. This proves the maid was in the room to work, not have consensual sex, investigators told the news station. Described as a 'good Muslim' by a close friend the maid was an asylum seeker from Guinea - one of the poorest countries in Africa. She was granted asylum, according to lawyer Mr Shapiro, and netted the job at the prestigious Sofitel in order to support her now 15-year-old teen daughter. If she had been earning Guinea's average annual wage of $1,000, it would have taken her three years to stay just one night in the suite where the alleged attack took place. Mr Shapiro said yesterday that the maid had no idea there was a man inside the suite she went into clean or that he was a famous French politician. She was now 'alone in the world' after her life had been 'turned upside down' by the alleged attack,' he said. 'She can't go home, she can't go back to work. This has been nothing short of a cataclysmic event in her life,' he added. He also dismissed suggestions by Strauss-Khan's legal team that the woman had made up charges or is trying to cover up a consensual encounter.

(Hitting back: Jeffrey Shapiro, the lawyer for the hotel maid said the woman will testify against the IMF boss before a grand jury) Hitting back: Jeffrey Shapiro, the lawyer for the hotel maid said the woman will testify against the IMF boss before a grand jury Strauss-Khan has denied all of the charges against him, which include sex abuse, a criminal sex act, unlawful imprisonment and forcible touching. His lawyer Benjamin Brafman said he is confident his client will be exonerated once all the physical evidence is collected at his arraignment on Monday. Strauss-Khan is currently on suicide watch at Rikers Island prison where he is being held without bail after a judge turned down a $1million offer at the hearing in Manhattan's Criminal Court. Norman Seabrook, president of the correction officers union, said Strauss-Kahn did or said something during a mental health evaluation that concerned doctors, and he is being monitored day and night. A law enforcement official, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of prisoner medical information, said Strauss-Kahn had not tried to harm himself. Because he is such a high profile person Strauss-Khan has been placed in a cell on his own at the notorious prison complex. Meanwhile calls for the 62-year-old to step down as head of the powerful International Monetary Fund, intensified with U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner saying Strauss-Kahn 'is obviously not in a position to run' the agency."

"Europe races to claim top job at IMF Reuters | 01:12 AM,May 21,2011 By John O'Donnell and Lesley Wroughton BRUSSELS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - European leaders raced on Friday to nominate a successor for fallen IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn before a G8 summit next week, with French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde in pole position. As Europe rallied around Lagarde as their most likely choice for the International Monetary Fund's top job, which has always gone to a European, the most widely tipped potential candidate from among emerging economies ruled himself out. Strauss-Kahn was due to leave jail on bail on Friday and be placed under house arrest and round-the-clock monitoring after he was indicted for the alleged attempted rape of a New York hotel maid last Saturday. The man once seen as a possible next president of France denies the charges and has vowed to prove his innocence. Lawyers representing Strauss-Kahn posted $1 million in bail and a $5 million insurance bond, but said other release conditions set out by a judge -- which included being placed under 24-hour home detention with electronic monitoring -- needed to be resolved before he could be released. German Chancellor Angela Merkel all but endorsed Lagarde, telling a Berlin news conference: ""Among the names mentioned for the IMF succession is French Minister Christine Lagarde, whom I rate highly."" But diplomats said some European Union countries questioned whether the well-regarded corporate lawyer, who would be the first woman to head the IMF, could be anointed before a special court decides next month if she should be investigated in a French legal case. Since Strauss-Kahn resigned on Wednesday, EU governments have rushed to find a European replacement before emerging nations, which have long demanded a bigger say in running the Washington-based global lender, can mount a bid for the job. Asian, Middle Eastern and African diplomats at the IMF headquarters in Washington said emerging nations were seeking a consensus candidate. That task was made harder when former Turkish economy minister Kemal Dervis, seen as the front-runner among potential non-European contenders, ruled himself out. ""Speculation about succession at the IMF has included me in the group of persons with relevant experience. But I have not been, and will not be, a candidate,"" he said in a statement. The New York Times reported that Dervis had an affair with a subordinate when he was a senior World Bank executive. Asked to comment, his office at the Brookings Institution in Washington said he would have no further statement. QUICK REPLACEMENT"" European and U.S. officials want to move quickly to replace Strauss-Kahn but they also risk angering developing economies if they are seen to do a backroom deal for Europe again. ""We are consulting broadly with the fund's shareholders from emerging markets, as well as advanced economies,"" said U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, stressing that the process should be open and move quickly. ""We are prepared to support a candidate with the requisite, deep experience and leadership qualities, and who can command broad support among the fund's membership."" The United States and European nations jointly hold more than half of the IMF's votes, giving them enough power to decide who leads it. Diplomats said European Council President Herman van Rompuy, who chairs summits of the 27-nation EU, and European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso were trying to secure a deal on Lagarde after the three biggest European powers -- Germany, France and Britain -- threw their weight behind her. Jean-Claude Juncker, who chairs euro zone finance ministers, and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi endorsed her on Thursday. ""It has to be a quick decision. It would be best to have consensus before going to the G8,"" one diplomat said. Leaders of the Group of Eight industrialized nations -- the United States, Russia, Japan, Canada, Germany, France, Britain and Italy, plus the European Union -- meet in the French seaside resort of Deauville on May 26-27. Strauss-Kahn, a global high-flier, spent the last of four nights at New York's notorious Rikers Island jail on Thursday. Once released, he would be taken to an undisclosed location where he would be safely and discreetly handed over to lawyers and, possibly, members of his family to avoid the media, said a spokeswoman for the New York City Department of Correction. He would also have unlimited access to his lawyers to prepare his defence. Under his IMF contract, Strauss-Kahn is entitled to a one-off payment of $250,000 with annual pension payments ""far, far less than that amount,"" the IMF said, dismissing media reports of a bigger package as ""grossly over-estimated."" Europeans argue it is essential to keep global finance's top job with the IMF so immersed in helping euro zone states such as Greece, Ireland and Portugal with massive debts. Some officials said the absence of Strauss-Kahn's powers of persuasion contributed to disarray in Europe this week over whether Greece should restructure or ""reprofile"" its debt. IMF official Ajai Chopra, following Strauss-Kahn's line, said a more comprehensive approach to the euro zone debt crisis was urgently needed and the EU should do more to help Ireland regain access to debt markets. The IMF board was due to hold a regular meeting on Friday to approve its part of a 78 billion-euro bailout for Portugal. It was unclear whether it would discuss the process for choosing a new managing director. LAGARDE UNDER SCRUTINY The case marks a spectacular fall for Strauss-Kahn, who was highly regarded for his part in tackling the global financial crisis of 2007-09 and Europe's debt crisis. His lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, has said the evidence ""will not be consistent with a forcible encounter."" Prosecutor John McConnell said on Thursday the maid, a 32-year-old from Guinea, told a ""compelling and unwavering story."" An arraignment hearing is set for June 6, when Strauss-Kahn will formally answer the charges, but a trial may be six months or more away. If convicted, he could face 25 years in prison. A Frenchwoman considering filing a complaint against Strauss-Kahn over an alleged 2002 sexual assault in France does not want to testify to U.S investigators looking into the New York case, her lawyer said. Lagarde is also under some scrutiny. Chairman of the U.S. law firm Baker & McKenzie in Chicago before she joined the French government in 2005, she is a fluent English speaker and has experience balancing the demands of rich and developing countries. A public prosecutor has recommended that she be investigated for allegedly abusing her authority to sidestep the justice system and push through a 285 million-euro arbitration settlement with businessman and ex-minister Bernard Tapie, overruling Finance Ministry experts at key stages. She denies wrongdoing and says she is victim of a smear campaign. A special jurisdiction created to try ministers for offences committed while in office will rule in mid-June whether she should face a full inquiry. Diplomats said Belgium, whose finance minister may harbour IMF ambitions, was among smaller countries that queried whether Lagarde could be nominated before the case is cleared up. ""We must be absolutely certain that the candidate is able to serve until the end of the mandate this time,"" one said. China and Japan called for a transparent, merit-based process. A European source said Beijing was privately supportive of Lagarde who now needed Latin American backing. Russia and other ex-Soviet states backed the Kazakh central bank chief, Grigory Marchenko.

"NEW YORK -- The New York apartment where the former IMF leader is under house arrest on sexual assault charges has become a new tourist hot spot.

Sinclair, a prominent French TV journalist before her marriage to Strauss-Kahn, has stood by her husband since his arrest last Sunday. The 62-year-old economist is accused of sexually assaulting a maid in his suite at Sofitel, near Manhattan's Times Square. He has denied the allegations. Strauss-Kahn was released from Rikers Island jail on Friday on $1 million bail plus $5 million bond. A crowd of international reporters and onlookers is gathering around the clock outside the 21-story Empire Building at 71 Broadway, across from Wall Street. Strauss-Kahn was moved there Friday from his jail cell. Read All Comments Another Manhattan building rejected him, after residents expressed fears about the kind of 24-hour media frenzy being staged on Broadway behind police barricades. Amandine Atalaya, a correspondent for France's TF1 television channel, flew in from Paris after Strauss-Kahn's arrest. She estimated that she's done more than 200 standup reports from New York in the past week, getting only about four hours of sleep a night. Atalaya says U.S. media ""have been very harsh with Strauss-Kahn"" in a way she says French reporters are not. He stood a chance of becoming his country's next president, but now awaits his next New York court appearance, which is scheduled for June 6. Strauss-Kahn resigned Wednesday as managing director of the International Monetary Fund. The IMF has been working to find a successor to lead an organization that provides billions in loans to stabilize the world economy. France's finance minister, Christine Lagarde, has emerged as a front-runner to replace Strauss-Kahn, but emerging economies have pressed for an end to Europe's traditional stranglehold on the position of IMF managing director. The IMF has been accepting nominations from member countries for candidates to succeed Strauss-Kahn. Its executive board said it plans to make its selection by the end of June.

"By MICHELE MAATOUK LONDON—European stocks opened mostly higher Friday following a positive close on Wall Street, with sentiment boosted by initial public offerings on both sides of the Atlantic. London's FTSE 100 index opened 0.2% higher and Germany's DAX index was up 0.2% at 7372, while Paris's CAC-40 index was down 0.1% at 4025.18. The heavy losses seen at the start of the month following the correction in commodity prices have created some bargain-hunting opportunities, said Ben Potter at IG Market. ""Looking at the bigger picture, we've certainly seen a stabilization in commodities prices over the last week to 10 days, as well as a gradual improvement in overall risk appetite,"" he said. Traders said that IPOs by Glencore in the U.K. and LinkedIn in the U.S. have injected some momentum in the market. LinkedIn's stock closed up 109% at $94.25, making it 2011's best-performing IPO, according to data from Standard & Poor's. Glencore's shares ended flat amid heavy trading, in an indication of continued investor interest in resource interest equities. Despite the positive start, traders cautioned that the market remains worried about divisions over how to resolve Greek's sovereign-debt crisis. ""The European Central Bank's threat to pull funding for Greek banks in the event of any type of restructuring is an indication of the fears the Bank has of a contagion effect being set off throughout the European banking system,"" said Michael Hewson at CMC Markets. At the same time, investors will keep a close watch on the race to succeed Dominique Strauss-Kahn as head of the International Monetary Fund, which French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde is favorite to win. The economic calendar looks pretty quiet Friday, with no major U.K. or U.S. releases due. Euro-zone current-account data for March are released at 4:00 a.m. ET. Rabobank estimated that on an annual basis, the current-account deficit likely increased in April, continuing the deteriorating trend started in mid-2010. In Asia Friday, stock markets were mixed, and many bourses struggled to advance despite Wall Street's rise Thursday, with the Japanese market capped by caution about the economic outlook and losses in the utilities sector. Japan's Nikkei Stock Average was flat, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 fell 0.4%, and South Korea's Kospi Composite gained 0.3%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 0.1%, Taiwan's main index fell 0.6%, and the Shanghai Composite index added 0.1%. On Wall Street Thursday, major stock indexes staged their second straight gain as a doubling in LinkedIn's share price spurred hopes that IPOs can lure more investors into risk assets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished with a gain of 0.4%, at 12605.32, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 0.2% to 1343.60 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.3% to 2823.31. Investors said the sharp rise in professional networking site LinkedIn's stock on its first day of trading ignited hopes that successful IPOs can help drive more capital off the sidelines. The gains came in spite of a batch of weak economic data. Stocks lost some of their footing mid-morning after the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's reading on mid-Atlantic manufacturing activity plunged. Meanwhile, sales of previously occupied homes in the U.S. fell slightly in April. The data washed out some of the favorable sentiment that followed better-than-expected unemployment claims figures early Thursday. The euro was recently trading at $1.4328, from $1.4311 late in New York Thursday, and the dollar was at ¥81.76 from ¥81.53.

"EU's Barroso: 'Natural' for Europe to seek top IMF job Reuters | 10:33 PM,May 18,2011 BRUSSELS (Reuters) - If Dominique Strauss-Kahn decides to step down as head of the International Monetary Fund, Europe would naturally put forward a candidate to replace him, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said on Wednesday. Answering a question during a business summit in Brussels, Barroso said it was ""only natural that EU countries would feel a responsibility to put forward a good candidate"" for the top job at the Washington-based institution. He added that Europe had more than one potential candidate for the post if it were to come available, and said the issue needed to be dealt with soon. The managing director of the IMF has always been a European since the organisation was set up after World War Two. But China and other major emerging economies have increasing influence in the organisation and are seeking a greater role. « Previous Next » This is an automated news feed.

190	Affairs at work make firms uneasy	"Employees of any company tend to spend a large part of their time in the workplace, and that makes them liable to get emotionally involved with their colleagues.
And former Royal Bank of Scotland boss Sir Fred Goodwin's alleged relationship with a colleague came to light on Thursday, despite an injunction he had taken out in an effort to suppress the story.
""With all the recent news about sexual harassment lawsuits, many employees and employers appear to have forgotten this simple fact, and have become very uncomfortable with the idea of employees forming romantic relationships."	"Employees of any company tend to spend a large part of their time in the workplace, and that makes them liable to get emotionally involved with their colleagues. According to a 2002 survey quoted by the TUC, a quarter of all long-term relationships start at work. But of course, not all liaisons between co-workers are long-term. Some are flings, affairs, one-night stands - whatever you want to call them. And a couple of recent high-profile cases have thrown the spotlight on this area, reminding us all just how tricky life can get when human passions collide with corporate culture. Coverage of the rape charges levelled at Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who has now stepped down as head of the International Monetary Fund, recalled he had been investigated over an affair with an IMF economist while he was in charge of the organisation. And former Royal Bank of Scotland boss Sir Fred Goodwin's alleged relationship with a colleague came to light on Thursday, despite an injunction he had taken out in an effort to suppress the story. Both men, as well as being high-level financial figures, are also married to other women. Mr Strauss-Kahn was cleared of harassment and abuse of power in 2008, but the IMF board still described the incident as ""regrettable"" and ""a serious error of judgement"". As for Sir Fred, the main criticism he has so far attracted has been from the tabloid press. Once dubbed Fred the Shred for his cost-cutting ways, he has now been re-named Fred the Bed. Conflicts of interest Sir Fred's former bank has declined to issue any statement about its ex-head. ""It goes without saying that we have no comment to make,"" an RBS spokesman told the BBC. However, RBS did forward the relevant section of its code of conduct, which examines the ""possible conflicts of interest"" arising from ""relationships and associations"". ""The term 'relationship' is taken in its widest sense,"" says the document, ""from playing football with a customer, to sharing membership of the same private club or society with a supplier, to forming a close personal relationship with a colleague."" RBS is at pains to stress it ""entirely respects"" its employees' rights to from friendships and personal relationships at work. However, it says: ""There will be occasions when it will be appropriate to tell your manager about a relationship that may impact on your work."" It gives examples of such cases, including disciplinary procedures in which an employee might be called to rule on the conduct of someone with whom he or she is having a relationship. Since the details of Sir Fred's affair are not in the public domain, it is difficult to know whether he found himself in what RBS would call ""a potential conflict situation"". But the bank's code, in itself, seems fairly restrained and sensible. In effect, if you are in a relationship with a colleague, the bank does not need to know unless it could create a problem. Lawsuit fears The Washington-based IMF chose to release its updated guidelines on the subject this week. ""A close personal relationship between a supervisor and subordinate presents a potential conflict of interest and must be reported and resolved, usually by reassignment of one of the individuals to a different work unit,"" an IMF spokesman said in a statement. ""Failure to report and then resolve the potential conflict of interest constitutes misconduct and is grounds for disciplinary action,"" he added. But the whole issue was already a fraught one in North America. US-based websites advising employees who find love at work speak of ""the current state of paranoia surrounding employee dating"". ""Are you worried about being accused of sexually harassing a co-worker if you ask him or her out for a date?"" asks Gary Vikesland of Employer-Employee.com. ""Believe it or not, you do not have to worry. It is still legal to ask out a co-worker on a date and start a romantic relationship. ""With all the recent news about sexual harassment lawsuits, many employees and employers appear to have forgotten this simple fact, and have become very uncomfortable with the idea of employees forming romantic relationships."" Mr Vikesland's guidelines highlight the different role that the law plays in romantic relationships on either side of the Atlantic. In the US, it is used to ward off sexual encounters, while in the UK, it is used to keep them secret. But despite fears the UK might go the way of the US in trying to stop work colleagues forming close attachments, trade union officials say that threat seems to have been averted. ""Most sensible employers will recognise that where you have colleagues working alongside each other and putting in long hours, there will be relationships in the workplace,"" says Hannah Reed, the TUC's senior employment rights officer. ""Having clear policies in the workplace, avoiding someone managing their partner can avoid accusations of favouritism. It can also avoid problems in the workplace where relationships break down."""

"Previous high-profile wearers include Bernard Madoff and Martha Stewart; Dominique Strauss-Kahn would join a select disgraced band if forced to wear an electronic tag as part of a bail deal. After his humiliating police “perp walk” in New York, the image of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) boss wearing an ankle bracelet would add another symbol of shame for the beleaguered global finance titan. The Frenchman’s lawyers have pledged he would wear a tag -- which can track his location with cutting-edge Global Positioning System (GPS) technology -- as a condition for being freed from New York’s notorious Rikers Island jail. The monitoring device would be in addition to surrendering his passport, agreeing to stay in a strictly-controlled location in New York and paying a reported USD 1 million bail, according to reports. “If Strauss-Kahn were to be placed on GPS monitoring, it could be set to send signals giving his location minute by minute,” Marc Renzema, professor of criminal justice at Kutztown University in Pennsylvania, told AFP. Ads by Google “If he were to leave the allowed area or to cut the bracelet from his ankle, a signal would immediately be sent to a monitoring centre .. If a set number of signals were missed by the monitoring centre, an alarm would also occur.” Electronic tags, which these days can monitor a lot more than simply location, are used on thousands of defendants every year in the United States when house arrest is used as an alternative to formal custody. As well as the tag itself -- typically worn over socks for a man -- the system involves installing a base station in the apartment or location where the defendant is confined, linked by phone line to a monitoring centre. ... contd.

"Strauss-Kahn granted bail, house arrest ordered May 20, 2011 02:11 PM | Moneylife Digital Team NY court grants bail ($6 million), but with stringent conditions—the former IMF head will be tagged with an electronic device—judgement acknowledges that there is “a serious risk” that Strauss-Kahn could attempt to flee New York: Former International Monetary Fund (IMF) chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn was today granted $1 million bail under stringent conditions, which includes tagging him with an electronic device, after he was formally indicted on all seven counts of sexually assaulting a hotel maid here, reports PTI. 62-year-old Strauss-Kahn would be detained at home ringed by armed guards and has been told to surrender all travel documents. The New York Supreme Court Judge Michael J Obus asked him to pay an additional bond of $5 million as he acknowledged that there is “a serious risk” that Strauss-Kahn could attempt to flee. Strauss-Kahn, who has claimed innocence, was locked up in a New York prison since Saturday when he was bundled out of a Paris-bound flight and taken into custody on charges of sexually assaulting a chambermaid at Sofitel Hotel in Manhattan. Strauss-Kahn has been charged with a criminal sex act, attempted rape and unlawful imprisonment. “I expect that you will be here” for court, Obus said, addressing Strauss-Kahn directly. “I do want to make it very clear: If there is the slightest problem with your compliance, court officials would quickly alter the bail agreement,” the judge said. Strauss-Kahn looked tired as he sat in court wearing a blue shirt and gray jacket without a tie. His wife, Anne Sinclair, a French TV journalist, was present in court along with their daughter. Earlier, a grand jury indicted Strauss-Kahn on all seven charges he faced after his arrest on 16th May, including four felony counts and three misdemeanours. “These are extremely serious charges, based on the grand jury’s determination that the evidence supports the commission of non-consensual, forced sexual acts,” Manhattan district attorney Cyrus R Vance Jr said after the bail hearing. Strauss-Kahn is allowed to stay with his wife in the apartment. On 6th June, the court will hold an arraignment hearing in which the exact charges will be revealed. Strauss-Kahn, however, has to spend one more night at the Rikers Island prison where he is being held since Monday. Strauss-Kahn has given up his extradition rights, which he is granted as a French citizen. Strauss-Kahn is expected to plead not guilty. His lawyers have also said that the sex was consensual. Yesterday, Strauss-Kahn resigned from the IMF. “It is with infinite sadness that I feel compelled today to present to the Executive Board my resignation from my post of Managing Director of the IMF,” Strauss-Kahn wrote to the Washington-based IMF board. ""Dominique Strauss-Kahn has today informed the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) of his intention to resign as Managing Director with immediate effect,” the IMF said in a statement after it received a formal letter in this regard from Strauss-Kahn. Strauss-Kahn, a socialist politician, was seen as a possible contender for the 2012 presidential elections in France.

194	Normandy beach town prepares for G8 invasion	"DEAUVILLE, France (Reuters) - The gently sloping beaches of Normandy lend themselves well to invasions.
Next week, Normandy's seaside resort town of Deauville will see an invasion of a gentler kind: the annual Group of Eight summit, which will gather 18 heads of state and 2,500 delegation members to discuss North African unrest and other global issues.
Authorities have reason to be worried: the Deauville G8 is the first summit since U.S."	"DEAUVILLE, France (Reuters) - The gently sloping beaches of Normandy lend themselves well to invasions. From here, William the Conqueror set out to invade England in 1066 and in World War II they were the landing site for the allied assault on Nazi-occupied France. Next week, Normandy's seaside resort town of Deauville will see an invasion of a gentler kind: the annual Group of Eight summit, which will gather 18 heads of state and 2,500 delegation members to discuss North African unrest and other global issues. The G8 dignitaries should feel right at home in Deauville, which has been the playground of the Parisian elite for decades. In 1858, the Duke of Morny, a half-brother of Napoleon III, decided to create ""a kingdom of elegance"" and built the first half-timbered villas that give Deauville its unique look. A railway to Paris brought an aristocratic public, and the addition of a casino and luxury hotels set up Deauville to become one of Europe's party towns in the Roaring Twenties. Just two hours from Paris, Deauville is still a haunt for the wealthy, although the crowd is less exclusive now. ""Deauville is the logical place for an event like the G8. It has long been used to hosting important people from the world of politics and business,"" said Sebastien Bouchereau, who has written about Normandy for many years for a local newspaper. After the war, dozens of villas were destroyed and replaced by apartment buildings. The more egalitarian post-war zeitgeist took the edge off Deauville's elitism and by the time it served as a backdrop for Claude Lelouch's ""Un homme et une femme"" film in 1966, the city looked more dreamy than worldly. In recent years, the town of 4,000 people has been trying to extend its short summer tourist season, launching an American film festival and building a conference center. The cavernous hall that will host the G8 on May 26-27 was built 14 meters (46 feet) below sea level so as not to block the ocean view. It has hosted a series of meetings, most recently the leaders of France, Germany and Russia, but the gathering of the Group of Eight major economies is its biggest yet. BRACED FOR PROTESTS ""I hope that an important decision will be taken here and that it will be known as the Deauville decision. Like Bretton Woods,"" town mayor Philippe Augier told Reuters. He may be disappointed on that front. No big agreements are expected on burning issues like the conflict in Libya, and the agenda could be hijacked by a debate over who should head the International Monetary Fund following Dominique Strauss-Kahn's resignation over sex assault charges. Augier's bigger worry is whether, despite deploying some 12,000 police, the event could be marred by riots or attacks. G8 summits have become lightning rods for anti-globalization protest and since the disastrous 2001 meeting in Genoa, Italy, where a protester was shot and killed by police, all G8s have been in held in remote areas that are easily sealed off. Recent venues have included a lakeside resort in Canada; a hilltop hotel in Japan and a Baltic seaside resort in Germany. Activists are usually banned to a different town. This year, NGOs are allowed to meet in Le Havre, 40 km (25 miles) away. Oxfam France Director Luc Lampriere said he regretted that activists had no access to the summit. Asked if beaches could be used for an NGO invasion of sorts, he said: ""We don't have a navy and if we did I would not give away our plans."" But if the remote locations have kept protesters at bay, it has not stopped attacks elsewhere. During the 2005 summit in Gleneagles, Scotland, Islamist suicide bombers killed 52 people in an attack on the London transport system. Authorities have reason to be worried: the Deauville G8 is the first summit since U.S. forces killed al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, France has led the West's intervention in Libya and its ban on full-face Muslim veils has triggered calls for armed retaliation. Eight of the 16 people killed in a bomb attack on a cafe in Marrakesh, Morocco, last month were French. ""Vigilance was high already, but it has gone up a notch due to the death of bin Laden and the Marrakesh attack,"" interior ministry spokesman Pierre-Henry Brandet told Reuters.

195	Lagarde's IMF bid gets boost	"PARIS (AP) – France's frank, hard-working and chic finance minister, Christine Lagarde, emerged Friday as Europe's likely choice to lead the International Monetary Fund.
The IMF insists the departure of former chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn has not hurt its day-to-day operations, but it is clearly under pressure to find a successor fast to lead an organization that provides billions in loans to stabilize the world economy."	"PARIS (AP) – France's frank, hard-working and chic finance minister, Christine Lagarde, emerged Friday as Europe's likely choice to lead the International Monetary Fund. The IMF insists the departure of former chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn has not hurt its day-to-day operations, but it is clearly under pressure to find a successor fast to lead an organization that provides billions in loans to stabilize the world economy. A new chief would also draw attention away from the seamy scandal surrounding Strauss-Kahn, who quit this week to face charges in New York that he tried to rape a hotel maid. The 24-member executive board, which will pick Strauss-Kahn's successor, outlined late Friday the procedures it will use to pick the next IMF leader. Nominations will be accepted starting Monday until June 10, after which the board will choose the top three candidates to interview. While the nominations will be secret, the board said it would release the names of the three top candidates as chosen by the board. That change could be an effort to address the complaints of critics that the process has been too secret in the past. The board said it hoped to select the next IMF director by June 30. Lagarde's chances for the top IMF job got a boost Friday when Kemal Dervis, a former finance minister for Turkey, said he did not want to be considered for the position. The IMF may face a choice between naming its first woman leader or its first leader from the developing world. Emerging economies see Europe's traditional stranglehold on the position as increasingly out of touch with the world economy, but have not yet united around a candidate. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Friday that she ""very much appreciates the French finance minister.'' She insisted she wasn't announcing Lagarde's candidacy, just sharing her views. Lagarde, 55, has a clean-cut image and has been praised for her acumen in helping steer Europe through the global financial crisis and its more recent debt woes. She speaks impeccable English and spent much of her career in the United States as a lawyer. A champion swimmer as a teen, Lagarde is known for her colorful language and a sense of humor, and for being vocally pro-market in a capitalism-wary nation."
196	Why Powerful Men Can’t Keep Their Pants On	- Sports (Maccabi Tel Aviv Reaches Big Stage But Falls Short In Finale) Maccabi Tel Aviv Reaches Big Stage But Falls Short In Finale Maccabi Tel Aviv reached the Euroleague basketball finals this week after defeating Real Madrid 82-63 in their semi finals	"Strauss-Kahn in court with attorney Benjamin Brafman. Photo: AP. The number of public men destroyed of late through sexual scandals is simply staggering. Within 48 hours of each other we heard that IMF head Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who many believed would be the next President of France, as well as Arnold Schwarzenegger, until a few weeks ago the Governor of the most populous state in the Union, self-destructed with sex scandals. The stories themselves are beyond belief. An IMF chief, disciplined enough to oversee one of the world’s most important banks, is alleged to have forced himself on a hotel housekeeper. Schwarzenegger, disciplined enough to rise from immigrant status with a funny accent to become of the biggest movie stars in the world and one of the most powerful men in the United States, apparently could not muster the control to prevent himself from fathering a child with a woman who worked in his home. The biggest mistake we make in determining why powerful men cheat is to believe they’re looking for sex. If it’s sex they’re after they have wives who can cater to their needs. No, these men are looking for something else entirely: validation. Men cheat not out of a sense of entitlement but out of a sense of insecurity. And the bigger they are the harder they fall, not of arrogance but out of fear and weakness. What makes men slowly climb the ladder of success is a desire to prove they’re a somebody. They want to be and feel important. They seek to rise from the poverty of namelessness and the penury of anonymity. It is not the promise of their potential that drives them but the fear of being a nonentity. They absorb the noxious lie of a culture bereft of values that only money and power will rescue them from being a nobody. Therefore, even as they ascend the ladder of ‘success’  they do so with a gaping hole in their center. And whatever accomplishments they will shove into that hole – money, fame, power – it goes in one end and comes out the other. They never feel good about themselves. They are never content. They are defined by insatiability and characterized by voraciousness, which explains why Wall Street bankers who were earning tens of millions of dollars a year still felt it was not enough and cut corners to make even more. The first rule of success is that there is nothing on the outside that can compensate for a feeling of failure on the inside. External accouterments of success – from armored limousines to an army of personal bodyguards – can never protect you from the din of demons who whisper to you that for all you have achieved you are still are a big zero. And that’s why these men turn to women to make them feel good about themselves. They want to feel desirable. They seek to silence the inner voices that taunt them as to their own insignificance. Because of its power, sex has a unique capacity to make insecure men feel – however fleetingly – like they’re special. Having women desire them makes them feel desirable. So why can’t their wives give them this same feeling? Because the man who thinks of himself as a giant loser sees the woman dumb enough to marry him as a loser squared. She, as the woman who bears his last name and his children, is part of his entire loser package. But the woman who is not married to him, who has never aligned herself with his failures, remains eminently desirable and can thus make him feel the same. When Tiger Woods self-destructed with an alleged fifteen mistresses I was asked to be on a TV show discussing why he did it. He had a beautiful wife. Why wasn’t that enough? The male panelist next to me said, “It’s simple. Men love sexual variety and Tiger had the money and the fame to get it.” I responded, “If it was variety he was looking for, why did he have sex with the same woman 15 times over? Every single one of the women he allegedly cheated with looked just like his wife, a blond-haired Nordic bombshell. There was no variety. No Asian woman, no African-American woman, etc.” The explanation lay elsewhere. When he was a little boy they took Tiger, put a metal stick in his hand, and told him, “If you learn to use this better than any man who preceded you and knock that little white ball farther than anyone who competes against you, you’ll be a somebody,” which was another way of saying that right now you’re a nobody, you’re nothing. Contrary to the Biblical message that every human being is born a child of god. Tiger heard the opposite. You are either the child of success are you don’t’ exist. So no matter how many tournaments he won and how much money he earned in his mind Tiger still remained a nobody with a lot of trophies and a lot of money. But none of that external success changed the original message: he was born a zero. So he tuned to an endless number of woman to make him feel desirable and special. He sought someone who wanted him for his being and not his sporting prowess. And he was stupid enough to believe that any of these women would be out with him if he weren’t’ a champion. It was his wife alone who loved him, but in his selfishness he lost her. This also explains why so many men who cheat end up opening up emotionally to the women they cheat with. If it was just sex they were seeking they would not be sending these women texts telling them how lonely they are and how only she, the mistress, understood them. You may ask what this has to do with a renowned banker and politician allegedly attacking a hotel housekeeper? We don’t yet know all the circumstances of the alleged assault, so I do not wish to discuss this case in particular. But I have counseled enough men in similar circumstances to know that they don’t expect the woman to resist. When you inhabit a $3000 a night hotel penthouse – yet more external accouterments of success –and the woman in question is an immigrant cleaning up, you’re convinced she’ll be as impressed with the bells and whistles of success as you are and she’ll melt like putty in your hands. Her resistance becomes a complete shock. The motivation, however, remains the same. Men who inhabit the top social sphere are usually driven to get there by a constant need to prove themselves. And in taking a woman who would otherwise have no sexual interest in you and transforming her instantly into a woman who desires you, you quiet the failure demons for even a brief moment. In this sense, Strauss-Kahn’s comment in an earlier interview with the French publication Liberation, after he had been caught having an affair with a subordinate  – “Yes, I love women. So what?” – displays a stunning degree of self-ignorance. The degree to which he loves women was never the issue but rather the degree to which he hates himself. These scandals of decent men ruining themselves either through affairs or, much more seriously, through allegedly illegally and outrageously forcing themselves on women, should server as a wakeup call to a society that continues to have a single definition of success for men. It’s not your gentlemanly behavior, sense of personal honor, or your devotion to your wife and kids that makes you special. Noone really cares a hoot for all that. It’s rather the level of name recognition and money you attain that really makes you hot.

197	IMF boss asks for home detention	"AFP Dominique Strauss-Kahn is making a new bid to get out of jail, as investigators continue a painstaking search for DNA evidence in his sex assault case.
A judge denied Strauss-Kahn bail Monday, sending him to an isolated wing of Rikers Island.
Another hearing had been set for Friday, the deadline for prosecutors to bring an indictment, agree to a preliminary hearing or release Strauss-Kahn."	"AFP Dominique Strauss-Kahn is making a new bid to get out of jail, as investigators continue a painstaking search for DNA evidence in his sex assault case. Investigators cut out a piece of carpet in a penthouse hotel suite, which New York detectives and prosecutors believe may contain bodily fluids spat out after an episode of forced oral sex by a hotel maid, police officials told The Associated Press. Strauss-Kahn, jailed at New York's Rikers Island since Monday, filed a second application for bail on Wednesday and proposed to be confined to his daughter's Manhattan home 24 hours a day with electronic monitoring. Advertisement: Story continues below He was set for another bail hearing on Thursday afternoon. The French politician said in court papers that he had surrendered his passport and wouldn't flee the country. ""I do not intend to leave the United States of America without the permission of the New York Court,"" he said. In addition to examining the Sofitel Hotel suite for further potential DNA evidence, investigators were looking at the maid's keycard to determine whether she used it to enter the room, and how long she was there, officials said. One of the officials said that the DNA testing was being ""fast-tracked"" but that the results could still be a few days away. The maid, a 32-year-old immigrant from the West African nation of Guinea, told police that the 62-year-old Strauss-Kahn came out of the bathroom naked, chased her down, forced her to perform oral sex on him and tried to remove her underwear before she broke free and fled the room. Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly declined to comment Wednesday on the details of the evidence-gathering but said results of any DNA and other testing had not yet come back. He said the detectives investigating the case found the maid's story believable. ""Obviously, the credibility of the complainant is a factor in cases of this nature,"" Kelly said. ""One of the things they're trained to look for, and what was reported to me early on, was that the complainant was credible."" One of Strauss-Kahn's lawyers, Benjamin Brafman, said at his client's arraignment this week that the forensic evidence ""will not be consistent with a forcible encounter"". That led to speculation the defence would argue it was consensual sex. The woman's lawyer, Jeffrey Shapiro, has dismissed suggestions from some of Strauss-Kahn's defenders that she made up the charges or tried to cover up a consensual encounter. In court papers filed on Wednesday, Strauss-Kahn's lawyers proposed posting a $US1 million cash bail and confining him to the home of his daughter, Camille, a Columbia University graduate student, 24 hours a day with electronic monitoring. Strauss-Kahn ""is a loving husband and father, and a highly regarded diplomat, politician, lawyer, politician, economist and professor, with no criminal record,"" his lawyers said in court papers. The lawyers had proposed similar conditions at an earlier bail hearing but added the promise of home detention on Wednesday. A judge denied Strauss-Kahn bail Monday, sending him to an isolated wing of Rikers Island. Manhattan prosecutors didn't immediately comment on the bail motion. The hearing was set for 2.15pm local time on Thursday. Another hearing had been set for Friday, the deadline for prosecutors to bring an indictment, agree to a preliminary hearing or release Strauss-Kahn. Strauss-Kahn is one of France's highest-profile politicians and was seen as a potential candidate for president in next year's elections. His arrest shocked France. The scandal comes at a critical moment for the International Monetary Fund, which is trying to shore up teetering economies in Europe. The IMF is an immensely powerful agency that loans money to countries to stabilise the world economy. In exchange it often imposes strict austerity measures."
198	Paris would back IMF chief if he wants French jail	"France: France would support any request from former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn to serve jail time back home if he is convicted in New York on sex assault charges, the interior minister said Sunday.
Interior Minister Claude Gueant said he was not prejudging the outcome of the sensational court case, in which former presidential hopeful Strauss-Kahn is accused of a May 14 sex attack on a New York hotel chamber maid."	"France: France would support any request from former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn to serve jail time back home if he is convicted in New York on sex assault charges, the interior minister said Sunday. Interior Minister Claude Gueant said he was not prejudging the outcome of the sensational court case, in which former presidential hopeful Strauss-Kahn is accused of a May 14 sex attack on a New York hotel chamber maid. But if Strauss-Kahn is found guilty, and if he himself would rather serve time in a French jail than an American one, Paris would back any transfer request he made to the US authorities, Gueant told Europe 1 radio. ""The convicted party would have to agree and the two countries would have to agree, notably the country that carries out the conviction, which obviously is always very careful about receiving guarantees he would complete his term."" Prosecutors insisted on tough bail terms for the 62-year-old former director of the International Monetary Fund, fearing he would flee home to France, which has no agreement to extradite citizens facing trial in the United States. But, Gueant recalled, the two countries do have a convention under which convicts can sometimes be transferred to prisons in their homeland so that family members can visit them more easily."

""It is with infinite sadness that I feel compelled today to present to the executive board my resignation from my post of Managing Director of the IMF,"" Strauss-Kahn said in a statement released early on Thursday. ""I want to say that I deny with the greatest possible firmness all of the allegations that have been made against me,"" the statement added.

"After a week inside a jail cell and under worldwide scrutiny, accused Parisian pervert Dominique Strauss-Kahn disappeared Saturday inside his pricey pseudo-prison. Neighbors in his posh lower Manhattan tower/jail cell said they couldn't catch a glimpse of the accused sex offender, held under round-the-clock armed guard in their midst. ""I didn't see him, and it's very quiet,"" said one resident. ""I saw security in the building and the media across the street."" Strauss-Kahn arrived Friday night after posting $6 million to escape from Rikers Island. A Con Ed worker said the one-time potential French president made a decidedly low-key entrance. ""Two guys escorted him out of a black SUV,"" recounted Adley Ambrose, 34. ""He looked like a normal dude, but he was walking fast - like he wanted to get somewhere."" Once inside the building, where rents run from $3,250 per month for a one-bedroom, Strauss-Kahn vanished into his locked-down apartment. While the defendant remained absent, his high-powered defense team stayed busy. They solicited public relations advice from a Washington consulting firm headed by ex-CIA officers and American diplomats. And, according to the French newspaper Le Monde, they hired a global investigations firm headed by Bart Schwartz - one-time head of the criminal division in the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office. None of that mattered to resident Margaret Woodward, 19, who happily reported no sightings of the ex-International Monetary Fund head. ""I wasn't sure if I should feel comfortable,"" the LIM College student said. ""It's a little scary to have a guy like that inside your building."" Strauss-Kahn was accused in a seven-count indictment with sexually assaulting a 32-year-old Manhattan hotel maid inside his $3,000-a-night hotel suite. A fellow Frenchman living in the building said he only became aware of the Socialist Party leader's presence because of the corresponding media presence. ""It's no problem with me,"" said the man. ""What would you say to anyone who has been through this turmoil?"" Building resident Saumil Mehta, 29, had an answer to that question: How about a cold one? ""I'd see if I could have a beer with him and see what he's like,"" said the 14th-floor resident. ""If he attacked somebody, I obviously don't agree with that.""

Geithner said the IMF's 24-member executive board should formally designate an interim head. John Lipsky has been serving as acting managing director. Geithner praised Lipsky as a capable manager. Geithner's remarks at the Harvard Club of New York were the first on the case from a top Obama administration official. The blunt assessment will likely escalate the pressure on Strauss-Kahn to step down. It came in response to a question about what the IMF should do about its leadership crisis. ""I can't comment on the case, but (Strauss-Kahn) is obviously not in a position to run the IMF, and it is important that the board of the IMF formally put in place for an interim period someone to act as managing director,"" Geithner said. Strauss-Kahn is being held in a jail cell on charges of sexually assaulting a hotel maid. The United States has a major say in determining who will head the IMF, in part because it holds the largest number of votes at the 187-nation international lending agency."
