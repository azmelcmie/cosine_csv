# cosine_csv
Python code to view the cosine similarity between shortened news articles in a tsv format.

This code allows you to compare a list of postings, articles, etc. against one another. The results will appear in a csv form showing the scores as percentages. Ideally the input file will be a tsv file containing an index and a text body column.

This is an initial version and I will be enhancing the code in the near future.
